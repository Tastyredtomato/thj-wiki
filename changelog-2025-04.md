**Author:** Catapultam

## Changelog April 14 2025

## **Auto Idle and Auto-AFK Updates**

The **Idle** and **AFK** systems have been separated to improve player experience and reduce unnecessary network load.

- In non-combat, players become idle after 1 minute and AFK after 10 minutes.
- In combat, players become idle after 10 minutes and AFK after 30 minutes.

### Key Changes:
- **Idle** now reduces client position updates to improve performance in crowded zones like the Bazaar.
- **AFK** is now fully independent of idle and manual `/afk`. Automatic AFK will not override or be overridden by manual AFK status.
- Manual `/afk` remains active until toggled off and is unaffected by automatic behavior.
- Automatic AFK messages no longer interfere with manual or automatic AFK or idle states.
- The following actions now reset idle and AFK timers:
  - Moving items
  - Casting spells
  - Using `/autoattack`
  - Receiving messages
- **Trade** (start or finish) now forces a position sync for both parties.
- **Wearchange packets** (e.g., armor appearance updates) are now sent even while idle.
- **Buyers** and **Traders** are excluded from automatic AFK entirely.

---

## üí∞ **Alternate Currency Improvements**

- **Alternate currency** is now account-wide.
- Currency counts now automatically refresh when:
  - Reclaiming items
  - Creating currency
  - Updating currency values
- The **Reclaim** button now functions correctly with currency items on the cursor.

---

## üêû Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed integer underflow on 0-value runes.
- Fixed **Frenzy** so it can now critically hit as intended.
- Fixed **weapon glamours** not appearing on pets.
- Resolved various issues with glamours, illusions, and idle logic in the Bazaar.
- Pets summoned by **Doppelgangers** now correctly belong to their summoner‚Äôs owner.
- Fixed a bug where pets could become permanently detached from their owner.
- Fixed bug causing pet aggro to clear whenever taunt command was set, regardless of setting.
- Fixed a bug preventing pets with taunt off from properly gaining the 'Immune to NPC Aggro' flag
- Fixed a bug which caused pets to taunt enemies attacking their owner at unlimited range.

## 2025-04-09 17:46 - Entry 1359585216825655307
**Author:** Catapultam

**Auto AFK**

**Why this Change?** Part of what we see in a critical hub zone such as Bazaar, is extremely high CPU, lag, causing a bad experience for other players trying to zone into the zone and function at all. This change aims to drastically reduce packet spam in the zone, keeping the zone lean and leading to a much better player experience when using the Bazaar. When a player with 4 pets is running in circles in the zone, it sends enormous amounts of position updates to X number of players in the zone, even those who are idle and don't need all of these updates.

When clients go AFK they stop receiving packet updates for movement. When they go un-AFK they get synchronized with all the clients around them.

**Changes**

* When in a non-combat zone (Bazaar) - auto AFK timer is 60 seconds
* When in a combat zone - auto AFK timer is 10 minutes
* When you go AFK, we also toggle the native /afk flag on the client now
* When a client initiates a trade with another client, both clients in the trade get auto-marked as non-AFK
* When a client finishes a trade with another client, both clients in the trade get auto-marked as non-AFK
* Heading now takes part in triggering when a client "moved" to remove them from auto AFK status
* Client messaging is now simply "You are AFK." / "You are no longer AFK."

4/2/2025 (Yes, this one is real)
```
- Reverted class deletions. Implemented <<# a u t o s k i l l>> instead
  - Initially supports the following Skill attacks
      Backstab
      Bash
      Tiger Claw
      Eagle Strike
      Dragon Punch / Tail Rake
      Flying Kick
      Round Kick
      Kick
      Frenzy
  - Absolutely no timer deconfliction is executed by the command, please only enable skills you want to be used.

- Implemented #attackmode
  - Rangers no longer display their bow by default. Any character can use #attackmode ranged to preferentially use their bow for autoattack and display

- Implemented #petcmd
  - Pet window buttons (and hotkeys created from them, or /pet commands) only send instructions to the 'active pet' (the pet displayed in the window)
  - 'Triple-pet' UI mod is not recommended, as it may be confusing as to which pet is 'active'
  - added #petcmd to send instructions to ANY pets (send commands by class name, etc)
  - Usage: #petcmd [attack, qattack, follow, guard, sit, stop, taunt (on\\off), hold (on\\off), ghold (on\\off), spellhold (on\\off), focus (on\\off), back, regroup (on\\off)] [all, mag, bst, nec, enc, shm, dru, brd, shd].
  - Any number of command and target verbs may be used at the same time, and in any order
  - /pet health and #petcmd health now display inventory for that pet

- Removed access to #mystats. On most servers, the inventory\player profile page is inaccurate and so mystats is needed. On this one, due to the unique nature of our technology, the inverse is true.

- Corrected bug which allowed creation of augmented items that were not usable in any slots.
- Syncrosatchels or equivalents will now consider slotted augments to determine which slot an item can be equipped into
- Splinters of Time which are not PRI\SEC\RANGE no longer require slotting into a weapon

- The Fennin event in plane of fire should now correctly resume when returning to the zone and no longer fails on timeout.
- Plane of Earth a ring events rewritten to be more resilient to zoning out. (Thanks Pippz)
- Echo added to Splitpaw
- Mortal Coil is no longer blocked by random clickies
- Villagers in HoHA are now tethered and will not run full marathons.
- 61-65 LDoN spells have been added to PoP parchment turn in rewards
- 50-60 LDoN spells have been added to Warders, Ancients, Lords and Ladies in Velious
- Mistakenly remaining GoD and OoW spells have been removed from PoK vendors *and* player spellbooks.
- Lvl 62 BST and lvl 63 Necro pet now correctly scale their level.

**Author:** Catapultam

```
- Implemented the new Player Rendering Overhaul!
This feature, unique to THJ, will provide an unparalleled graphics experience like you have never seen before! Enjoy AAA quality which you had never imagined that you'd see in this game. Please note that this is a REQUIRED feature, and out of date clients will be disconnected automatically, so please remember to patch!

- Nerfed Mnk/Mnk/Mnk
- Removed several redundant player classes; Monks, Rogue, Warrior, Wizard, Berserker are all classes who's roles are better performed by other classes, and so these have been permanently disabled.
- Bard has been removed because it is just too much trouble and causes too many bugs.
```
