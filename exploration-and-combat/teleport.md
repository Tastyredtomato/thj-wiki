# Teleport Unlocks
[Zone Guide](/exploration-and-combat/zone-guide/) | [ZEM](/exploration-and-combat/zem) | [Echo of the Past Zones](/exploration-and-combat/echo-of-the-past) | [Teleport Unlocks](/exploration-and-combat/teleport)

You can find Tearel in the Bazaar, or in the East Commons tunnel and he can teleport you to various destinations by hailing him and following the prompts. 

You unlock these teleport destinations by visiting the zone, and looking for the teleport runes. Once you step on them you will get a message saying that you are now familiar with that place.
