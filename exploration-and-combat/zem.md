  <h2>Zone Experience Modifiers (ZEM) Overview</h2>
  <p>If all were equal, killing two mobs of the same level in different zones would give the same amount of XP. 
     However, in EverQuest (EQ) some zones grant more (or less) experience than others for mobs of the same level. 
     These multipliers are known as ZEMs.</p>

  <p>
    Originally, the EQ developers introduced ZEMs to reward players for tackling riskier or more complex zones. 
    Dungeons often receive higher ZEMs, while outdoor zones typically have lower ones. 
    <br><br>On <strong>The Heroes Journey</strong>, we share these values so you can plan your leveling path accordingly.
