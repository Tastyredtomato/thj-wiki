# What is a Language?
A language is a special type of skill in Everquest that allows you to understand some NPCs, quest items, and other players based on your skill level as a proficiency in the language. Your skill level determines how much of the text is randomly jumbled both when using the language towards masterful speakers and interpretting it when it's used towards you.

## Learning a Language
Each race has their own distinct language(s) that they start with. Additional languages can be learned from various Guild Masters around Norrath. <br><br>Some languages are considered "Secret Languages" and these are the languages of races which have been stupefied by Deities, exiled from civilization, or whose own tongue has been lost to time. Secret languages normally require special learning methods such as hanging around chatting monsters, attempting to interpret items, or journeying to specific masters to teach them. <i>Some of these methods do not work on The Heroes' Journey.</i> <br><br>On The Heroes' Journey, all of the Guild Masters in Bazaar can teach all learnable languages except Dark Speech to members of their class, though some languages have level restrictions for when they can be Trained from a Guild Master.

## Skilling Up Languages
It can be costly to train languages to 100 via Guild Master, and you will run out of skill points before maxxing all of the languages out.

Because of this, many players will opt to skill up languages via the Group Say command, which can be done in a Group even without your groupmates present as a method of self-teaching. Unknown languages can also be learned by having other players speak to you in group chat via Group Say (/gs) while in the same zone as you, even if you start without the language known. The rate at which you learn languages is based on your INT or WIS, whichever is higher.

In order to set your spoken language, you must right click the header for your Main Chat window and left click select your language from the Language expandable button. Changing your language in other chat windows will have no effect.

On The Heroes' Journey, only groupmates in the same zone as you--including yourself--will receive skill ups, and you do not need to zone between skill ups to receive them. The UI may need you to zone to update your current skill total. An additional difference is that a teacher does not need to be more skilled than the learner, allowing a character with 1 rank in a language to train their group--including themselves--to 100.

## Languages
Languages and some information about them are listed below. Some languages can be trained at lower levels by races that either start with them, are allied with races who speak those languages, or share a cultural relationship with those languages. <br><br>Not all languages in the table are currently available.<br>
