# What is a Language?
A language is a special class of skill in Everquest that allows you to understand some NPCs, quest items, and other players based on your skill level as a proficiency in the language. Your skill level determines how much of the text is randomly jumbled both when using the language towards masterful speakers and interpretting it when it's used towards you.

## Learning a Language
Each race has their own distinct language(s) that they start with. Additional languages can be learned from various Guild Masters around Norrath. On The Heroes' Journey, all of the Guild Masters in Bazaar can teach all languages to members of their class, though some languages have level restrictions for when they can be Trained from a Guild Master.

## Skilling Up Languages
It can be costly to train languages to 100 via Guild Master, and you will run out of skill points before maxxing all of the languages out.

Because of this, many players will opt to skill up languages via the Group Say command, which can be done in a Group even without your groupmates present as a method of self-teaching. Unknown languages can also be learned by having other players speak to you in group chat via Group Say (/gs) while in the same zone as you, even if you start without the language known.

On The Heroes' Journey, only groupmates in the same zone as you--including yourself--will receive skill ups, and you do not need to zone between skill ups to receive them. The UI may need you to zone to update your current skill total. An additional difference is that a teacher does not need to be more skilled than the learner, allowing a character with 1 rank in a language to train their group--including themselves--to 100.
