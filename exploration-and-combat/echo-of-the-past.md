# Echo of the Past Zones & Expeditions

    
The Echo of the Past NPC allows you to create a Dynamic Zone (DZ) of the zone that is either "Respawning" or "Non-Respawning". Only you and your expedition will be in the zone once it is created. 
<br>
|Respawning|Non-Respawning|
|-------------------------|
|Respawning instances are good for experience and exploration. | Non Respawning zones are good for finding and killing the bosses in that zone.  |
|The zone will have non boss mobs spawned. |The zone will have all mobs and most bosses spawned. |
|Mobs will respawn on their usual timers if their timer is under 2 hours. |Mobs will not respawn after death.|
|Mob HB and Loot tables are standard. |After a third player joins the expedition, an increase in loot chance, mob HP and mob damage occurs. 25% per player. First two are excluded. |
|Lock out for 2 hours| Lock out for 14 hours|
<br>
> For zones that have mobs with greater than 2 hour respawns, such as some of the planes, there will be NO mobs in the zone under a Respawning instance. 

## Lockouts
When you create the Dynamic zone it will start a timer that you can view by pressing alt-z or from the EQ icon: Quests->Expeditions. If that is your active expedition, you can freely enter and exit it. But once you "Quit Expedition", you cannot re-enter it until the lock out timer expires and you create a new Dynamic Zone.
