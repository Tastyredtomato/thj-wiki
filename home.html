<h1><strong>Welcome to The Heroes’ Journey Wiki</strong></h1>
<p>You heard a voice cry out to you from the void…<br>It was familiar, calling you back…<br>And return you must—stronger than ever.</p>
<p>From the creators of <i>Retribution</i> and <i>Pyrelight</i> comes <i>The Heroes’ Journey</i>—a fresh take on a timeless classic.</p>
<p>This is your chance to relive the adventures that shaped you, but with a twist: you are no longer bound to a single class path. Embrace <strong>Seamless Multiclassing</strong>, wielding the powers of up to three classes at once. Harness <strong>thousands of AAs, spells, and disciplines</strong>, forging your own legendary hero as you personally progress through each expansion. Along the way, seek out <strong>Enchanted and Legendary</strong> versions of your favorite gear, growing in strength with every step of your journey.</p>
<h4><strong>Seamless Multiclassing</strong></h4>
<p>Your Warrior was tanky, but why stop there? Be your own <strong>holy trinity</strong>, or adapt to fill any role your group needs.</p>
<h4><strong>Enhanced Loot</strong></h4>
<p>Your favorite pixels are here—now in three rarities of increasing power.</p>
<h4><strong>Class-Defining AAs</strong></h4>
<p>No more waiting four expansions for your class to shine. Every class starts with powerful AAs, letting you <strong>immediately</strong> fulfill your role.</p>
<h4><strong>Personal Progression</strong></h4>
<p>Expansions unlock not by timers, but by <strong>your achievements</strong>. Prove your worth and carve your own path forward.</p>
<h4><strong>Free Trade</strong></h4>
<p>That epic piece of gear? If you can’t use it, <strong>trade it</strong> for something you can.</p>
<h4><strong>Increased Spawn Rates</strong></h4>
<p>No more endless camping—<strong>named spawns have been cut down to just over ten minutes</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Discovery-Based Fast Travel</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>No Box, No MQ</strong></h4>
<p>No need to box—just you, your <strong>epic class combinations</strong>, and your friends.<br>No need for MQ either—your map has all the tools you need.</p>
