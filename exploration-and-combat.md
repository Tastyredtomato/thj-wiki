## Echo of the Past Zones

The **Echo of the Past NPC** allows players to create **Dynamic Zones (DZ)** that are either:
- **Respawning** – Enemies will respawn over time.
- **Non-Respawning** – Once an enemy is defeated, it stays down.

Only you and your expedition members can enter the instance, making it perfect for controlled encounters and focused exploration.

## Teleport Unlocks

Teleportation can make travel easier, but you'll need to unlock destinations first.

- Find **Tearel** in *The Bazaar* or *East Commons Tunnel*.
- Hail him and follow the prompts to teleport to available locations.
- Unlock new destinations by **stepping on teleport runes** within various zones.
- A confirmation message will appear when a new teleport option is unlocked.

## Zone Experience Modifier

**ZEM** stands for **Zone Experience Modifier**, which determines how much experience you earn in a zone.
- **Default ZEM: 2.0x** – Most zones have a base experience modifier of 2.0.
- **Hot Spots** – Occasionally, GMs will boost experience rates in select zones. These are spread via word of mouth.
