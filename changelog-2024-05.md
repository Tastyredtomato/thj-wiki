üëÄ  What's that tag?

Hey Admins and Mods! Starting May 15, it's possible you might notice something new next to some of your members' usernames: ‚ú® **Guild Tags **‚ú®

See a cute little tag next to a member's username or profile? That's a **Guild Tag**, which indicates someone's membership to a chosen Guild. You can click on this tag to see the Guild profile, and even apply for membership there as well. What this means for you, beloved Admins and Mods, is that if your server's AutoMod is on, it will also check for Guild Tags ‚òëÔ∏è

**What's a Guild?** It's a small, exclusive server that members can apply to join. These servers are tight-knit communities where members can relish in shared identities, hobbies, play styles, and more!
> Please note that Guilds are only available to a small number of servers at this time, so not every server has access to this experiment. Additionally, our support team cannot manually add servers to this experiment.

Much love,
The Discord Team
