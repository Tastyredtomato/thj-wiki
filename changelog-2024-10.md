```

**Important Note:**

It has been decided that VP 2.0 launching with Kunark is a poor overall experience for a number of reasons.

VP moving forward will drop 1.0 loot and its bosses will be scaled back to fit in between Kunark progression targets and Velious dragons. They will keep most of their mechanics but the effects and stats have been reduced by about 60%.

This should make it feel like an end game Kunark experience, and with the availability of Enchanted/Legendary gear, still worth doing in era.

The mobs and abilities may be adjusted further.
