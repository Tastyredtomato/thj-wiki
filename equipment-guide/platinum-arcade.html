<h1 style="text-align:center;">Platinum Arcade</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">A reach into the coffers of a Mischievous Halfling with nothing better left to do.</p>
<h2>Who</h2>
<p>Once a being of immense power in possession of untold riches he has amassed from this world and beyond, the Mischievous Halfling descends upon the Bazaar of Norrath to exchange adventurers' hard-earned Platinum and Echoes of Memory for a randomized conjuration of his wealth. He extracts equal joy from both the disdain of loss and revelry in wealth, providing rewards from beyond our world and time in exchange for coin or memories to add to his ever-growing hoard. The Mischievous Halfling bears a striking resemblance to a Deity of Norrath who in olden days was counted amongst a troupe nestled into a hidden stage.</p>
<h2>Where</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>Upon ‘Hail’ing the Mischievous Halfling, he will inform you how he works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One may click his chat prompt for Echo of Memory to deduct two Echo of Memory from their Alt. Currency tab automatically and be rolled a reward from his</p>
<h2>What</h2>
<p>The Mischievous Halfling cycles his wares periodically as his whims demand. This entails a change to the current items available, additions of new ones. Previously, he's even taken place in events and given out A Strangely Wrapped Gift, Wilting Rose of Erollisi, and Easter Eggs.</p>
