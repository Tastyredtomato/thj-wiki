# Platinum Arcade

<center>A reach into the coffers of a Mischievous Halfling with nothing better left to do.</center>

## Who is he?

Once a Deity in possession of untold riches he has amassed from this world and beyond, the Mischievous Halfling descends upon the Bazaar of Norrath to exchange adventurers' hard-earned Platinum and Echoes of Memory for a randomized conjuration of his wealth. He extracts equal joy from both the disdain of loss and revelry in wealth, providing rewards from beyond our world and time in exchange for coin or memories to add to his ever-growing hoard. The Mischievous Halfling bears a striking resemblance to a Deity of Norrath who in olden days was counted amongst a troupe nestled into a hidden stage.<br>

## Where is this internorrathian Halfling of mystery?

## How can I obtain untold riches?

<div><details>
  <summary><strong>Upon ‘Hail’ing the Mischievous Halfling, he will inform you how he works</strong></summary><div class="comparison">
<span>  A Mischievous Halfling says 'Well looky there! Feeling lucky? Come win a prize! Mounts, Petamorph Wands, Illusions, Clockwork friends... delicious foods and potions to boot! If you want to try your luck at a game of chance, simply hand me 5,000 platinum pieces, or consider donating to wager two [<button style="color:magenta;">Echo of Memory</button>], I'll accept those, too!'</span></details>
One may click his chat prompt for Echo of Memory to deduct two Echo of Memory from their <strong>Alt. Currency</strong> tab automatically and be rolled a reward. Alternatively, providing him 5000 platinum by clicking the coins onto him and confirming to Give them to him will also provide a reward.<br>

## What does he have?

The Mischievous Halfling cycles his wares periodically as his whims demand. This entails a change to the current items available, additions of new ones, or maybe even a removal of exhausted stock! Previously, he's even taken place in events and given out Turkeys, Wrapped Gifts, Roses, and Easter Eggs.<br>
While the Mischievous Halfling has much in storage, he does a poor job of keeping tally and we could only pry some vague descriptions from his ale-sullied noggin:

These delicious morsels provide stats until consumed, but he considers them a loss!
