# Tribute

>Tribute is a system you can access in game via the `ALT+U` hotkey.

These are focus effects that use a currency called favor. You gain favor by donating items to Tribute Merchants. They can be found in bazaar, east commonlands, and various towns.

Every 10 minutes while tribute is active, the Active Cost of favor will be subtracted from your current favor. You can activate and deactivate tribute via ALT+U's window, but are penalized by 10 minute durations.

Note that tributes are really just items being equipped into invisible slots, so they don't "stack" in any different way to normal items. So, HP tribute effects will stack, but focus effects, instrument masteries, haste, etc will not stack, only take best of your tribute or equipped items with an effect.

There is a full list of tribute effects below that includes both the level required, and the cost of each level.
