Your eyes here
<!--It’s following me again. I know it is. That wet, glistening orb--bloodshot, twitching like it’s trying to blink but it can’t, it can’t because it’s not in a socket anymore, it’s loose, floating, hovering, wobbling like a balloon tied to some invisible thread. And the bag--it holds the bag. A wrinkled, grease-slick leather thing clutched impossibly tight by its optic nerve, swinging like a pendulum of impending doom, and I swear I saw it twitch. Not the eye. The bag. As if something inside was moving. It doesn’t make sense, nothing makes sense.-->
