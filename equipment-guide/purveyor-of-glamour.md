# Purveyor of Glamour

<center>Grasping beyond the veil, she coalesces visions of past and future into a corporeal form.</center>

## Who is she?

An aesthetic soul of unknown origin, the Purveyor of Glamour waits in the Bazaar for payment for her services paid in platinum to transform items into their Glamoured versions. She also provides a unique opportunity to reach into realms unknown, times immemorial and retrieve the essence of gear worn by Heroes of the past, present, and future.<br>

## Where is she?

## What is a glamour?

A Glamour is a cosmetic augmentation that fits into the large augmentation Slot 6 in most visible gear. This overwrites the look of the item, and instead displays the Glamour. A few warnings come with these:

<details>
<summary><strong>Dye</strong></summary><div class="comparison">
<span><strong>Glamours do not inherit dye from slots.</strong><br></span>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Classic Models</strong></summary><div class="comparison">
<span>When making use of Classic Models via #tim or .ini modification, some undesired Glamour <strong>features</strong> present. These <strong>features</strong> range from Glamours not displaying to a range of graphical glitches spanning from inconvenient to performance-impacting. These <strong>features</strong> are unsupported and we recommend using new models to mitigate any <strong>features</strong> encountered with Glamours due to Classic Models.</span>
</div>
</details>
  
## How can I obtain Glamours?

The Purveyor of Glamour offers three distinct services:
<details>
<summary><strong>Convert an Item</strong></summary><div class="comparison">
Clicking an item onto the Purveyor of Glamour will open a handin window. By providing an item that has a valid Glamour as well as a fee of 5000 platinum pieces via the handin window, you will receive back a cosmetic augmentation version of the item provided as long as it has a valid Glamour version.
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Custom Enchantments</strong></summary><div class="comparison">
  By providing the Purveyor of Glamour two Echo of Memory from your <strong>Alt. Currency</strong> window, she can consume their power to pluck the visage of a piece of gear from the ether, providing you one randomized Glamour.
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Exchange Glamours</strong></summary><div class="comparison">
Providing four items which have "'Glamour' - " in their name to the Purveyor of Glamour will extract their essence. A significant portion of this essence is lost in the unpredictable process of restructuring a new item, so what remains will only be one randomized item.
</div>
</details>

## Slots

Several slots can be Glamoured. Some of these behave in unexpected ways, but most importantly the item that they go on must be defined as the same item Type as the item they came from. Some of these behaviors are documented below:
<details>
<summary><strong>Glamourer Hands Back Item</strong></summary><div class="comparison">
<span>The Glamourer hands back items that don't have a valid Glamour associated with them despite being paid 5000pp. If an item has a valid Glamour in <span><a href="https://eqdb.net/">EQDB</a> already, please report the item and its Glamour with links as a #bug on the Discord.<br>
<br>
If the item does not have a valid Glamour, then it is not currently available to be fixed and may appear in a future batch.</span>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Head</strong></summary><div class="comparison">
<span>Some items are defined as Gems or Jewellery due to being "vendor trash." If an item can't accept or be used as a Glamour for this reason, please report it as a #bug on the <a href="discord.gg/heroesjourney">Discord</a>.</span>
