# Epics

Epic Weapons are powerful, class-specific weapons obtained through **multi-stage questlines**. Each class has a unique **Epic 1.0, Epic 1.5, and Epic 2.0**, with enhanced versions offering increased power.

- **Epic 1.0** – The original class-defining weapon, often requiring long quests.  
- **Epic 1.5** – A more accessible version, but still powerful.  
- **Epic 2.0** – The ultimate evolution, unlocking unique effects.
