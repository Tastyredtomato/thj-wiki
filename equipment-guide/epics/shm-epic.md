<h2>Spear of Fate: Quest Guide</h2>
<br><br>

<h2> Truespirit for Lazy Shamans</h2>
Kill <a href=https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/68032> Peg Leg</a> in Butcherblock to spawn a lesser spirit.
Hail a lesser spirit (Faction Truespirit: Not KOS) and follow the dialogue to recieve a Tiny Gem. Repeat this 20 times to recieve 20 Tiny Gems.
<ul>
  <li>Say "yes"</li>
<li>Say "threatened my life"</li>
<li>Say "what are you"</li>
<li>Say "know more"</li>
  </ul>
<li>Give Tiny Gem to <a href=https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/8003>Bondl Felligan</a> in Freeport. Repeat this 20x. This increases your Truespirit Faction to a level that all subsequent steps are possible.</li>

<h2> The only other step </h2>

Kill Terror, Freight, or Dread in Plane of Fear to spawn an Iksar Broodling. Kill an Iksar Broodling and loot a <https://eqdb.net/item/detail/1673>Child's Tear</a>

<li>In City of Mist (non-respawning) use Pick lock or <a href=https://eqdb.net/item/detail/20886>Key of Torsis</a> to take the elevator up to the <a href=https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/90005>black reaver</a> on the second floor until <a href=https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/90183> Lord Rak`Ashiir</a> spawns. Give him a Child's tear and he will attack. Kill and loot Iksar Scale.</li>

<li>Turn in Iksar Scale to <a href=https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/94141> Spirit Sentinel</a> and recieve <a href=https://eqdb.net/item/detail/2010651>Spear of Fate (Legendary)</a>! This will also reduce your Truespirit Faction, so subsequent shaman epics will require Peg Leg step repeating.</li>

DRAKE, leaving the rest below, its unnecessary.

<h2>Pre-farmable Steps include:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Step 4 – Loot Envy and Woe from Glaron the Wicked. Loot Marr’s Promise from Tabien the Goodly. Both are in Rathe Mountains.</li>
  <li>Step 9 Part 1 – Loot 6 random drops from City of Mist</li>
  <li>Step 10 – Loot 3x Books from Lord Ghiosk in City of Mist</li>
  <li>Step 11 – Loot Icon of the High Scale (ground spawn) in City of Mist</li>
  <li>Step 16 – Loot Child’s Tear in Plane of Fear</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Start off by heading to Ocean of Tears. Find Captain Surestout on Cyclops Island (+2500, -3000). Kill him. This will spawn a lesser spirit. Say “i wish to know more” to receive Tiny Gem.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alternatively, you can spawn a lesser spirit by killing Peg Leg in Butcherblock Mountains, an iksar manslayer in Field of Bone, or Blinde the Cutpurse in Rathe Mountains. The idea is to get a Tiny Gem from any of these lesser spirits. You only need one.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go to West Freeport and locate Bondl Felligan. He is behind a fake wall out in the field area. Give him Tiny Gem (100 faction increase). He will start pathing. Follow him, and when he stops, say “you can buy booze“.
  </li>
  <li>
    He will then continue pathing to the basement of The Jade Tiger’s Den. Once he arrives, you will see a greater spirit to his right.
  </li>
  <li>
    Say “Heyokah” to a greater spirit to receive Opaque Gem.
  </li>
  <li>
    Say “Walk the path“ and a greater spirit will despawn.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make sure you have Enduring Breath. This part of the epic can be slow. Head to Erud’s Crossing and find Ooglyn (-920, +1630). Give her Opaque Gem. She will instantly repop and, after about 10 seconds, will start moving. Be patient and just keep following. She should swim to approximately (-1580, +4160) underwater in the western side of the zone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Eventually, she will say “Ok, here Is place for you to for waiting. Hab fun shaman!”. At this point Ooglyn will swim off. Stay put and wait for Srafen the Soaked to spawn.
  </li>
  <li>
    Five NPCs will spawn in the following order: Srafen the Soaked, Dillon the Drowned, Froham the Forgotten, and Abe the Abandoned (a greater spirit). All will spawn at or near (-1580, +4160). Be patient; a tracker can help ensure you haven’t missed a spawn.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can go through the dialogue as shown below, although it appears you may not need to. I recommend doing it anyway.
  </li>
  <li>
    The whole event took 28 minutes for me after the original emote: “Ok, here Is place for you to for waiting. Hab fun, shaman!”. Spawn times may vary.
  </li>
  <li>
    Srafen the Soaked – Say “here”, “wait”, “us”, “else”.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dillon the Drowned – Will spawn after a bit; say “no”, “disastrous”.
  </li>
  <li>
    Both NPCs will swim off after a couple of minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Srafen the Soaked will ask you to follow him. You don’t need to; he just roams and eventually despawns. Stay put and wait for Froham the Forgotten.
  </li>
  <li>
    Froham the Forgotten – Say “who are you” then follow the dialogue until he mentions an arrow. He won’t respond to the arrow text, but the next NPC, Abe the Abandoned, will.
  </li>
  <li>
    Froham the Forgotten will ask you to follow him, but you don’t need to. Wait for Abe the Abandoned to spawn.
  </li>
  <li>
    Abe the Abandoned – Say “a broken arrow“, “i will give them the arrow“ (He will give you Broken Arrow, used in the Epic Retelling Epic Ornament Quest). If you only say “give them the arrow” as suggested, you may not get a response. Abe will swim off; stay where you are.
  </li>
  <li>
    A greater spirit will spawn shortly. Say “Hail“, “next path” to receive Small Gem.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 4</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Head to Rathe Mountains. Kill and loot two NPCs. The items are tradable:
    <ul>
      <li>Tabien the Goodly – Level 32. Loot Marr’s Promise.</li>
      <li>Glaron the Wicked – Level 32. Loot Envy and Woe.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 5</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go to West Karana and find a wandering spirit. It roams, so a tracker helps.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give it Small Gem by itself (100 faction increase).
  </li>
  <li>
    Next, give it Marr’s Promise, Envy, and Woe to receive Sparkling Gem (100 faction increase).
  </li>
  <li>
    Follow the quest dialogue if needed; ensure you have the Sparkling Gem before leaving.
  </li>
  <li>
    Note: You can also say “shield of falsehood” to receive Shield of Falsehood. This item is not used in the Epic quest but is a bonus item you can wear.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 6</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go to Emerald Jungle and locate Spirit Sentinel (+1250, +280) — note it is near the middle of the zone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give it Sparkling Gem (100 faction increase). (I was at 500 – Kindly faction.) Follow its dialogue.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 7</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go to Castle Mistmoore and locate Black Dire (+100, -150). (Level 45, 200 hits, Harmtouches.)
  </li>
  <li>
    If he is not up, you can supposedly kill an advisor in the castle to spawn him (not confirmed).
  </li>
  <li>
    Say “i will not join you” to Black Dire. It may not respond; kill it anyway and loot Black Dire Pelt.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 8</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go back to the Spirit Sentinel in Emerald Jungle (+1250, +280) — note it is near the middle of the zone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give it Black Dire Pelt (100 faction increase).
  </li>
  <li>
    It should now speak to you. Say “how it all began” to receive Ancient Journal (6-slot container).
  </li>
  <li>
    You will also receive Black Fur Boots (Instant self-only SoW clicky)!
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 9</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go to City of Mist and kill trash mobs until you get the following six drops. Five drop from trash; Student’s Log drops from a spectral courier (who can spawn in the stables or courtyard):
    <ul>
      <li>Crier’s Scroll</li>
      <li>Merchant’s Letter</li>
      <li>Personal Diary Page</li>
      <li>Priest’s Diary Page</li>
      <li>Student’s Log</li>
      <li>Written Announcement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Once you have all six, combine them in Ancient Journal to create Completed Report.
  </li>
  <li>
    Turn in Completed Report to the Spirit Sentinel in Emerald Jungle (+1250, +280) — note it is near the middle of the zone. (100 faction increase)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 10</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go back to City of Mist and kill Lord Ghiosk. He spawns after you kill a black reaver behind the first locked door in the back of the zone.
  </li>
  <li>
    A pick lock class is useful to open the door, or you can get a Stone Key from the Captain of the Guard.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lord Ghiosk drops 3 books you’ll need to loot:
    <ul>
      <li>Crusades of the High Scale</li>
      <li>Head Housekeeper’s Log</li>
      <li>Historic Article</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 11</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    While in City of Mist, pick up the ground spawn Icon of the High Scale (+130, -366). It is on ground level inside the North temple in a small room.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 12</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go back out to Emerald Jungle again. This time, travel to the Lake on the North side of the zone.
  </li>
  <li>
    There you will find a second Spirit Sentinel under water.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give it Crusades of the High Scale, Head Housekeeper’s Log, and Historic Article (100 faction increase).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 13</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Head to The Hole and find High Scale Kirn (-20, +260). A level 60 group should handle him with ease.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give him Icon of the High Scale. He will attack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Kill him and loot Engraved Ring.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 14</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go back to City of Mist. You’ll need to spawn Neh’Ashirr by killing a black reaver inside the hut on the very last floating island.
  </li>
  <li>
    You’ll need a pick lock to get there; levitation is recommended due to a hole trap inside the hut.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once Neh’Ashirr has spawned, give him Engraved Ring. He will instantly respawn.
  </li>
  <li>
    Kill him and loot Neh’Ashirr’s Diary. A group of level 60s should be able to handle him.
  </li>
  <li>
    Note: Optionally, you can loot Key of Torsis (temporary) to open the City of Mist elevator later (for the final fight of the epic), but a picklock class works just as well.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 15</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go back to the Lake in Emerald Jungle. Give Neh’Ashirr’s Diary to Spirit Sentinel (1000 faction increase).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 16</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go to Plane of Fear. You will need to kill either Dread, Fright, or Terror to spawn Iksar broodling. It is level 1.
  </li>
  <li>
    Kill it and loot Child’s Tear.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 17</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go to City of Mist for the last time! You will need a lock pick again if you don’t have the keys.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlock the first door; then in the hallway behind the first black reaver, you will see a wooden platform on the ground (a locked elevator).
  </li>
  <li>
    Either pick the lock or use Key of Torsis (Temporary Key) from Neh’Ashirr.
  </li>
  <li>
    Take the elevator up and kill a black reaver in the back of the room to spawn Lord Rak’ashirr.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give him Child’s Tear. He will attack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Kill him and loot Iksar Scale.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 18</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go back to Spirit Sentinel in the lake in Emerald Jungle. Give him Iksar Scale to receive Spear of Fate! (Note: You’ll lose all your faction gained upon Epic completion.)
  </li>
</ul>
