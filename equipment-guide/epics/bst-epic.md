  <h1>Beastlord 1.0 Epic Guide – Claw of the Savage Spirit</h1>

  <h2>Pre-farmable Items</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Loot 2x Gem of the Void from reaper or Xi Xaui mobs in Maiden’s Eye</li>
    <li>Loot Chunk of Dense Fungal Padding from an ancient shrieker in The Deep</li>
    <li>Loot Perfect Acrylia Ore from trap golems in The Grey</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 1</h2>
  <p>
    Step 1 is the most tricky part of the entire epic. Go to Grimling Forest and head to the town area in the southeast (look for the light blue circle on the map). Grimling Forest has a “war” with roughly 10 battles taking place across the zone. You can tackle these battles individually – some will drop a Copper Medal of War, which is required for Beastlord 1.0. These battles may be inconsistent, so you might need to repeat them.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, speak to Captain Necin. He will offer to take you to a camp; say “ready to go” and follow him. Upon arrival, say “ready to fight” and kill all the mobs at the camp. A named mob (for example, Bloodguard Kavgis) may spawn; if it does, kill it for a chance at the Copper Medal of War. If not, simply repeat until you obtain one. Other NPCs in town may also offer similar opportunities.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2</h2>
  <p>
    Go to Shar Vhal and find Elder Animist Dumul. Use the “Find” function on nearby Elder Animist Sahdi to locate him. Give Elder Animist Dumul a Copper Medal of War to receive the Official Seal of the Khati Sha and a Carved Wooden Chest (a 6-slot container).
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3</h2>
  <p>
    In Emerald Jungle, locate Scout Vyrak. Hand over the Official Seal of the Khati Sha to spawn The Spirit of Rage. Kill the spirit and loot the Totem of the Gorilla. Then, give the Totem of the Gorilla to Scout Vyrak to receive the Wrapped Gorilla Totem.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 4</h2>
  <p>
    Head to Permafrost and find Scout Janomin (this mob typically has an estimated 24-hour respawn). Give him the Official Seal of the Khati Sha to spawn The Icebound Spirit. Kill it, loot the Totem of the Ice Bear, and then give that to Scout Janomin to receive the Wrapped Ice Bear Totem.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 5</h2>
  <p>
    Proceed to Feerrott and find Scout Ahlikal (also with an estimated 24-hour respawn). Hand him the Official Seal of the Khati Sha to spawn The Spirit of Decay. Kill it and loot the Totem of the Spider, then give that to Scout Ahlikal to receive the Wrapped Spider Totem.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 6</h2>
  <p>
    In Lesser Faydark, locate Scout Rahjiq (estimated 24-hour respawn). Give him the Official Seal of the Khati Sha to spawn The Spirit of Malevolence. Kill the spirit, loot the Totem of the Wolf, and then give that to Scout Rahjiq to receive the Wrapped Wolf Totem.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 7</h2>
  <p>
    Travel to Stonebrunt Mountains and find Scout Malom (estimated 24-hour respawn). Give him the Official Seal of the Khati Sha to spawn The Spirit of Torment. This spirit is found above the waterfall (using levitation may help you climb the wall). Kill it, loot the Totem of the Watcher, and then hand that over to Scout Malom to receive the Wrapped Watcher Totem.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 8</h2>
  <p>
    Go to Swamp of No Hope and locate Scout Eyru (estimated 24-hour respawn). Give him the Official Seal of the Khati Sha to spawn The Spirit of Sorrow. Kill it and loot the Totem of the Alligator. Then, give the Totem of the Alligator to Scout Eyru to receive the Wrapped Alligator Totem.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 9</h2>
  <p>
    Combine the following items in the Carved Wooden Chest to create the Sealed Box of Totems:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wrapped Gorilla Totem</li>
    <li>Wrapped Ice Bear Totem</li>
    <li>Wrapped Spider Totem</li>
    <li>Wrapped Wolf Totem</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 10</h2>
  <p>
    Go to Timorous Deep. Enter the zone from the Butcherblock dock and give the Seal of Elder Dumul to Scout Sihmoj. He will give you a Black Silk Sack (a 6-slot container). This action will also spawn six “Images” on the neighboring island to the east. Bring a couple of groups to be safe, kill all the spawned mobs, and loot six Shards of Broken Glass.
  </p>
  <p>
    Combine the shards in the Black Silk Sack to create the Sack of Broken Glass. Then, give this sack to Scout Sihmoj; he will return it and then despawn.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 11</h2>
  <p>
    Return to Shar Vhal and give the Sealed Collection Box to Weapons Master Rahoul to receive 2× Jagged Claw of Rending.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, hand the claws to Elder Animist Dumul in Shar Vhal to receive the Khati Sha Seal of War and an Acrylia Gilded Box (a 4-slot container).
  </p>

  <h2>Step 12</h2>
  <p>
    Obtain the following four items:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>2× Gem of the Void – Drops from reaper or Xi Xaui mobs in Maiden’s Eye (may also drop from Xin Thall Centien; uncommon drop)</li>
    <li>1× Chunk of Dense Fungal Padding – Drops from an ancient shrieker in The Deep (uncommon drop)</li>
    <li>1× Perfect Acrylia Ore – Drops from trap golems in The Grey (only trap golems drop this; uncommon drop)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Combine these items in Rahoul’s Collection Box to create the Sealed Collection Box.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 13</h2>
  <p>
    Return to Shar Vhal, give the Sealed Collection Box to Weapons Master Rahoul, and receive 2× Jagged Claw of Rending.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, give the claws to Elder Animist Dumul in Shar Vhal to receive the Khati Sha Seal of War and an Acrylia Gilded Box.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 14</h2>
  <p>
    Go to Fungus Grove and locate Scout Halmia near the Twilight Sea portal. Give her the Khati Sha Seal of War to spawn Draz Nurakk. Kill Draz Nurakk and loot his head.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 15</h2>
  <p>
    Combine 2× Jagged Claw of Rending, the Khati Sha Seal of War, and Draz Nurakk’s Head in the Acrylia Gilded Box to create the Sealed Gilded Wooden Chest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Give the Sealed Gilded Wooden Chest to Elder Animist Dumul in Shar Vhal to receive your Beastlord 1.0 Epic: 2× Claw of the Savage Spirit!
