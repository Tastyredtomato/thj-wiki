  <h2>Part 1 – Red Scabbard</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Head to East Freeport and find Kargek Redblade. Say “what favor” to receive Wax Sealed Note.</li>
    <li>Head to Feerrott, give Oknoggin Stonesmasher your Wax Sealed Note to receive Tiny Lute.</li>
    <li>Head back to East Freeport, give Kargek Redblade your Tiny Lute to receive Redblade’s Legacy. Hold onto it.</li>
    <li>Head to Permafrost Keep, kill a goblin wizard and/or a goblin warlock. Loot a Heart of Frost. It is a fairly common drop.</li>
    <li>While you’re here, you can grab a Block of Permafrost from the ice giant area if you want. You’ll need it later in the quest (See Part 2 – there are two options).</li>
    <li>Head to East Karana, give Tenal Redblade your Redblade’s Legacy to receive Totem of the Freezing War.
      <ul>
        <li>Tenal Redblade can be found on the far east side of the zone at the bottom of the gorge below the Highpass Hold zoneline.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Give Tenal Redblade both the Totem of the Freezing War and Heart of Frost to receive Totem of Fiery War.</li>
    <li>At this point the only items you should have are Totem of Fiery War and Block of Permafrost.</li>
    <li>Next, collect 4 items from raid bosses:
      <ul>
        <li>Green Dragon Scales (Tradable) – Drops from:
          <ul>
            <li>Severilous – Emerald Jungle</li>
            <li>Hoshkar – Veeshan’s Peak</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Red Dragon Scales (Tradable) – Drops from:
          <ul>
            <li>Lord Nagafen – Nagafen’s Lair</li>
            <li>Echo of Nortlav – The Hole (2.0 Only?)</li>
            <li>Talendor – Skyfire Mountains</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Hand of the Maestro – Drops in Plane of Hate from Hand of the Maestro. Drop rate varies; generally drops on the first kill. Can also be spawned via an instance. Respawn time reported as 12 hours (unconfirmed).</li>
        <li>Spiroc Wingblade – Drops in Plane of Sky on Island 5 from The Spiroc Lord. He death touches so bring two tanks and someone to resurrect. If you leave The Spiroc Guardian up (Island 5 boss), The Spiroc Lord will respawn upon death, allowing multiple attempts. It does not always drop; use this method if The Spiroc Lord is not visibly holding it.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Once all four items are obtained, head back to East Karana to Tenal Redblade.
      <ul>
        <li>First, give him: Green Dragon Scales, Red Dragon Scales, Totem of Fiery War to receive Mark of the Sword.</li>
        <li>Then, give him: Mark of the Sword and Hand of the Maestro to receive Tenal’s note to Kargek.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Now go back to East Freeport and find Kargek Redblade. Give him Spiroc Wingblade and Tenal’s note to Kargek to receive Red Scabbard.</li>
  </ul>
