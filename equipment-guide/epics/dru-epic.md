  <li><em>You may need to complete the “Muffin for Pandos” quest in West Freeport to gain enough faction if he doesn’t speak to you (amiable minimum).</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Go to <strong>Greater Faydark</strong> at Loc: +1535, +570. Clear the orc pawn PH’s until you find the correct one that spawns <strong>Faelin Bloodbriar</strong>. Kill the PH until Faelin spawns and then give her the <strong>Worn Note</strong> to receive <strong>Faelin’s Ring</strong>.</li>
  <li><em>You can also forage a <strong>Ripened Heartfruit</strong> here (see Step 7).</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Go to <strong>Kithikor Forest</strong> and track down <strong>Giz X`Tin</strong> (he roams, so you’ll need to search). Give him <strong>Faelin’s Ring</strong> to receive a <strong>Dark Metal Coin</strong>.</li>
  <li>When you turn it in, <strong>Teir`Dal Reaver</strong> will spawn and attack (no need to kill it).</li>
