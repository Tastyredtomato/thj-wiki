<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>
  Go to <strong>Burning Woods</strong> and locate <strong>Telin Darkforest</strong> at (+3240, +2880). Say “action” to receive a <strong>Worn Note</strong>.
  <em>You may need to complete the “Muffin for Pandos” quest in West Freeport to gain enough faction if he doesn’t speak to you (amiable minimum).</em>
</p>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>
  Go to <strong>Greater Faydark</strong> at Loc: +1535, +570. Clear the orc pawn PH’s until you find the correct one that spawns <strong>Faelin Bloodbriar</strong>. Kill the PH until Faelin spawns and then give her the <strong>Worn Note</strong> to receive <strong>Faelin’s Ring</strong>.
  <em>You can also forage a <strong>Ripened Heartfruit</strong> here (see Step 7).</em>
</p>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>
  Go to <strong>Kithikor Forest</strong> and track down <strong>Giz X`Tin</strong> (he roams, so you’ll need to search). Give him <strong>Faelin’s Ring</strong> to receive a <strong>Dark Metal Coin</strong>.
  When you turn it in, <strong>Teir`Dal Reaver</strong> will spawn and attack (no need to kill it).
</p>

<h2>Step 4</h2>
<p>
  Return to <strong>Burning Woods</strong> (Telin Darkforest) and give him the <strong>Dark Metal Coin</strong> to receive a <strong>Worn Dark Metal Coin</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Step 5</h2>
<p>
  <strong>5A)</strong> Head to <strong>East Karana</strong> and find <strong>Althele</strong> (located at –3660, –1590). Give her the <strong>Worn Dark Metal Coin</strong> to receive a <strong>Braided Grass Amulet</strong>. This will also spawn <strong>Sionae</strong> nearby (–2590, –1600).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>5B)</strong> Give <strong>Sionae</strong> the Braided Grass Amulet to receive a <strong>Frayed Braided Grass Amulet</strong>. This will spawn <strong>Nuien</strong> (–3650, +300).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>5C)</strong> Give <strong>Nuien</strong> the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet (he will return it) and this will spawn <strong>Teloa</strong> (–3850, –2850).
</p>

<h2>Step 6</h2>
<p>
  Go to <strong>Misty Thicket</strong> and track down <strong>Ella Foodcrafter</strong>. Give her an <strong>Earth Stained Note</strong> to receive a <strong>Shiny Tin Bowl</strong>.

  <li><strong>Innothule Swamp:</strong> Speckled Molded Mushroom</li>
  <li><strong>Misty Thicket:</strong> Sweetened Mudroot</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>7B)</strong> Once all four items are obtained, combine them in the Shiny Tin Bowl to create a <strong>Hardened Mixture</strong> (keep the bowl).
</p>

<h2>Step 8</h2>
<p>
  You now need to raise your faction with <strong>Keepers of the Art</strong>. Buy 3,000 <strong>Batwing</strong> from any merchant (for example, <strong>Darius Gandril</strong> in the West Trade Building on the Plane of Knowledge) and turn them in to <strong>Niola Impholder</strong> in <strong>South Felwithe</strong> (reachable via the middle teleport pad). This will raise your faction to <strong>Ally</strong> (though <strong>Amiable</strong> is sufficient).
  You’ll also receive some copies of the level 1 Mage spell <strong>Flare</strong> (which you can sell).
</p>
<p>
  <em>You must be at least Indifferent with Keepers of the Art to do this quest.</em>
</p>

<h2>Step 9</h2>
<p>
  Go to <strong>Timorous Deep</strong> and locate <strong>Alrik Farsight</strong> (near the Chessboard – the quickest way is via the Butcherblock Dock). Say “i will take the artifact” to receive a <strong>Crushed Pot</strong>.
