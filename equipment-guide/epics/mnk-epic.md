<h2><a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/10652">Celestial Fists</a>: Quest Guide</h2>
<ul>
  The Celestial Fists quest challenges the monk to confront and defeat the four elemental masters—beginning with Eejag of Fire in Lavastorm's molten pits, then summoning Gwan of Air in the Plane of Sky, followed by Trunt of Earth in Nurga's shadowed depths, and finally facing Xenevorash of Water in the Lake of Ill Omen—each battle proving the monk's mastery over the elements through martial discipline and spiritual fortitude. After collecting the elemental tokens, the monk must seek out Kaiaren's dual aspects in Trakanon's Teeth and present the mystical Book of Celestial Fists alongside the Demon Fangs, ultimately earning the legendary handwraps that embody the perfect union of physical prowess and enlightened wisdom.
