<h2><a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/11050">Fiery Defender</a>: Quest Guide</h2>
    <ul>
      The Fiery Defender quest requires the hero to purify three tainted artifacts—a darksteel sword from The Hole, a shield from Nektulos Forest, and a breastplate from the Plane of Hate—through acts of sacrifice, compassion, and purification, before delivering them to Reklon Gnallen in Erudin to receive the Mark of Atonement, which must then be presented alongside the Fiery Avenger to the tortured spirit of Irak Altil in the Plane of Fear, ultimately redeeming his honor and earning the legendary Fiery Defender.
    </ul>

  <!-- ────────── A Tainted Shield ────────── -->
  <div class="quest-card" id="shield">
<h2>A Tainted Shield</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The first of <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/72078">Irak Altil</a>'s tainted armaments for you to find comes from <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/25301">Kirak Vil</a> in Nektulos Forest. He carries a <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29002">Tainted Darksteel Shield</a>. Pick it up and make your way to The Hole next.</li>
</ul>
  </div>

  <!-- ────────── An Ancient Blade ────────── -->
  <div class="quest-card" id="sword">
<h2>An Ancient Blade</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Irak spoke of <q>Hands of a twisted brother no longer living</q> that now has posession of the blade he carried when he abandoned his post so long ago. Delve into The Hole until you find the <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/39116">Keeper of the Tombs</a>. Kill it and the other creatures in the room and retrieve the <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29000">Tainted Darksteel Sword</a> from the Keeper's corpse.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- ────────── A Tainted Guard ────────── -->
  <div class="quest-card final" id="bp">
<h2>A Tainted Guard</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Finally your task is to track down the vile temptress that caused Irak to abandon his post in the first place. You'll find the <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/186150">thought destroyer</a> in Plane of Hate. Destroy her and loot the <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29001">Tainted Darksteel Breastplate</a>.</li>
</ul>
  </div>
  
  <!-- ────────── Cleansing the Taint ────────── -->
  <div class="quest-card final" id="legwork">
<h2>Cleansing the Taint</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Now that all of Irak's lost armaments have been recovered, they must be cleansed of their taint before they can be returned to him. The cleansing will require some additional items - 
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29006">Pure Crystal</a> - Obtained in North Kaladim
      <ol>
        <li>Enter North Kaladim and find <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/67056">Jark</a>. Tell him <q>I will get your dinner</q> to spawn <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/67090">Nella Stonebraids</a> in the Temple area.
        <li>Find <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/67090">Nella Stonebraids</a> and say <q>Do you have Jark's dinner?</q>. Receive <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29007">Cold Plate of Beef and Bread</a>.</li>
        <li>Take the Cold Plate of Beef and Bread back to <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/67056">Jark</a>. Give him his dinner to receive <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29006">Pure Crystal</a>.</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
      <li>Next, head to Northern Felwithe. Find <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/61013">Elia the Pure</a> standing by the pond. Give her the <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29002">Tainted Darksteel Shield</a> so she can wash it in the pond for you. Receive <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29005">Gleaming Crested Shield</a>.</li>
    <li>Finally, you'll need a <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29009">Bucket of Pure Water</a>. In West Freeport, near the Monk guild, you'll find a <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/9122">peasant woman</a>. Tell her <q>What water?</q> and <quote>I will take it to him</quote>, receive <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29008">Bucket of Water</a>. Take this to <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/9121">Joshua</a> and hand it to him. Receive <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29009">Bucket of Pure Water</a>.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If she does not respond to "I will take it to him", try "I will take it to Joshua". Make sure she is targeted when doing the /say lines.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul> 
  </div>
  
  <!-- ────────── Redemption ────────── -->
  <div class="quest-card final" id="final">
<h2>Redemption of Irak Altil</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As Irak was a Paladin of the Temple of Quellious at the time of his betrayal, only a Paladin of the same order can cleanse his armaments. Make your way to Erudin and find <a href="https://eqdb.net/npc/detail/24044">Reklon Gnallen</a>, who is a Paladin guildmaster and should be available on Find.</li>
  <li>Hand Reklon - 
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29009">Bucket of Pure Water</a> and <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29000">Tainted Darksteel Sword</a>. Receive <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29003">Gleaming Crested Sword</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29006">Pure Crystal</a> and <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29001">Tainted Darksteel Breastplate</a>. Receive <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29004">Gleaming Crested Breastplate</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29003">Gleaming Crested Sword</a>, <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29004">Gleaming Crested Breastplate</a> and <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29005">Gleaming Crested Shield</a>. Receive <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29010">Mark of Atonement</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Now that Irak's arms have been cleansed and his atonement granted, he must be informed! Return to the Plane of Fear and find him. Hand him the <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/29010">Mark of Atonement</a> and your <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/11050">Fiery Avenger</a> to receive your <a href="https://eqdb.net/item/detail/11050">Fiery Defender</a>!
      <p><b><center>NOTE THERE IS A CLICK! This can be a 1hand OR 2hand weapon!</center></b></p>
    </ul>        
  </div>
  <p class="reward">Kneel no more, valiant champion of light. You have purified the tainted relics, braved the planes of gods, and proven your worthiness beyond all measure. The Fiery Defender you now wield stands as testament to your unwavering courage and virtue—may its holy flames illuminate the darkest corners of our realm and strike fear into the hearts of all who threaten the peace we hold dear.</p>
