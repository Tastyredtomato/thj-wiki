  <h1>THJ vs Live Comparison</h1>
<div class="intro-card">
    <h2>What is the difference between THJ and Live?</h2>
    <p><strong>In short, a lot.</strong></p>
    <p>
        This document was written by <strong>Rougesareth</strong> as an attempt to catalog the technical 
        changes between the live server and <strong>The Hero’s Journey</strong>. An attempt was made 
        to write it in a “general” manner, without relating to the specific live patch at the time of 
        this writing. This was quite easy to write thanks to the documentation skills of both 
        <strong>Catapultam</strong> and <strong>Aporia</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It should be noted that <strong>Cata writes very funny patch notes</strong>. 
        Please read the original changelog for the full experience.

</div><div class="thj">
<span class="label">THJ:</span><br> All equipment, including bags, can drop as "regular", "enchanted", or "legendary", increasing the power of the item.

<summary><strong>Group & Raid Content</strong></summary><div class="comparison">
<div class="live">
<span class="label">Live:</span><br> Getting groups is almost impossible in the wild, most players are forced to box for any hope of success. If you want to see the highest level content you will have to join a raiding guild and follow their schedule.

</div><div class="thj">
<span class="label">THJ:</span><br> You can create a "respawning" instance, or a "non-respawning" instance. A respawning instance functions normally but will not spawn named enemies with a high respawn timer, such as Lord Nagafen or Lady Vox. A "non-respawning" instance will spawn each enemy only once, but will guarantee the spawn of every named mob that isn't on a short respawn with a placeholder cycle (double check these mechanics). The lockout timers for the two modes are separate, and are 2:00 and 14:00 hours apiece.
</div>
</div>

<summary><strong>Movement Grace & Server Ticks</strong></summary><div class="comparison">
<div class="live">
<span class="label">Live:</span><br> On live, it seems like movement is clientside and just does sanity checks with the server, so when you move is when you start moving, and when you stop is when you stop moving. thus, the 0.5s cast period allows for true slidecasting style to the extent that 0.5s cast spells can always be cast while moving.
</div><div class="thj">
<span class="label">THJ:</span><br> On eqemu/classic, zone ticks are always happening. in true classic, you have to feel out ticks for everything and mostly time them by regen ticks. On THJ, baseline, this works a little different due to using luclin-style out-of-combat regen and character-specific regen ticks. This means when you move, you can't actually tell when you're getting snapshotted as having moved unless you have an amazing feel for it, because you're just a model at a point that was facing a direction and moving a direction. Standard server-side snapshotting with little client handshaking.
