<h1>A–C</h1>
<h2>A</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1.0 Achievements</h3>
<p>Achievements provide goals for your character and can inspire new things to accomplish. You can always open the achievement window to see a list of possible objectives and challenges to pursue.</p>
<p><strong>Opening the Achievements Window:</strong><br>Currently disabled for The Heroes' Journey.</p>
<p><strong>Achievements anyway?</strong><br>Slayer titles for 500, 5000, 10000, 50000, and 1,000,000 enemies! Also, some easter-egg titles!</p>
<p><strong>Rewards:</strong><br>Some achievements reward you with small bonuses, such as titles for your character.</p>
<hr>
<h3>1.1 Alternate Advancement</h3>
<p>Alternate Advancement (AA) allows your character to gain abilities outside of regular level progression. You can allocate some of your earned experience into AA, which can then be spent to unlock powerful abilities (commonly referred to as AAs). You can start earning AAs as early as level 1.</p>
<p><strong>Opening the AA Window:</strong><br>Press [V] to open the Alternate Advancement window.<br>Alternatively, open your Inventory by pressing [I] and click the "Alt. Adv." button at the bottom left.</p>
<p><strong>Navigating the AA Window:</strong><br>The window has several tabs across the top, each containing a list of AA abilities.<br>Click on each tab to explore the available AAs and learn what they can do for your character.<br>Be sure to check the requirements listed for each ability.</p>
<p><strong>Using Experience for AAs:</strong><br>In the top right of the window, you'll see "Exp to AA." Here, you can choose how much of your experience will go toward AAs instead of level gain.<br>As you fill the AA exp bar, you'll earn AA Points, which can be spent on AA abilities.<br>Keep in mind that experience gained from levels 1-50 is lower per kill, based on the enemy's con, compared to levels 50+.</p>
<p><strong>Learning and Using AA Abilities:</strong><br>Once you have enough AA Points, click on the ability you want to learn and press the "Train" button on the right.<br>Some AAs are always active once learned, while others need to be activated.<br>To activate an AA ability, select it, then click the "Hotkey" button under the "Train" button. This will create a Hotbutton that you can place on your Hotbutton bar for easy use during gameplay.</p>
<hr>
<h3>1.2 Augmentations</h3>
<p>Augmentations are special items that you can embed into weapons or armor to enhance their power. These items are marked with the Augmentation tag in the item information window. To view this, right-click and hold on the item. You’ll also see the slot types that the augment fits into at the bottom of the item description.</p>
<p>Note: Restrictions on both the augment and the item are additive when you embed the augment. For example, if the augment requires your character to be a Troll and the item requires level 30, the augmented item will require a Troll character of at least level 30.</p>
<p><strong>Embedding an Augment:</strong><br>Ensure that the item has the appropriate slot type for the augment (indicated in the augment's description).<br>To embed the augment, simply click on the augment to place it in your cursor.<br>With the augment on your cursor, click the highlighted augment slot on the item (the slot will turn yellow if it's compatible with the augment).</p>
<p><strong>Removing Augmentations:</strong><br>To remove an augment, you'll need to use an augmentation distiller, which can be purchased from the Augmentation Vendor in the Bazaar.</p>
<hr>
<h3>1.3 Auto-attack</h3>
<p>Auto-attack is a useful feature, especially for characters who engage in melee combat. The default key to activate auto-attack is [Q]. Pressing this will cause your character to automatically attack your current target, as long as it's within melee range.</p>
<p><strong>Ranged Auto-attack:</strong><br>Use the command /autofire ON to enable automatic ranged attacks.<br>When enabled, your character will make ranged attacks as often as possible, provided you have ammunition available.<br>You have unlimited ammunition here on THJ, so you only need (2) arrows in the arrow slot (for safety) and (1) in the quiver, for ranged-haste.<br>autofire lets you attack with your bow in melee range, unlike ranged attack.<br>To turn off automatic ranged attacks, use the command /autofire OFF.</p>
<hr>
<h3>1.4 Auto-run</h3>
<p>Auto-run is a feature that allows your character to run forward without needing to press any arrow keys. You can still turn left or right while using auto-run.</p>
<p><strong>To toggle Auto-run:</strong><br>Press the [NumLock] key on the numpad to activate.<br>To disable, press the [NumLock] key again or use the up/down arrow keys on your keyboard.</p>

<h3>2.0 Acquiring, Selling, and Buying Items</h3>
<p>The most common way to acquire items is by defeating monsters in battle and looting their corpses. Keep in mind that you can only loot an NPC corpse if the damage your group did was greater than anyone else's. It's considered good etiquette not to interfere in combat unless asked.</p>
<p><strong>Looting a Corpse:</strong><br>To loot a monster you’ve killed, right-click on its corpse to open its inventory.<br>Right-click on the items you want to keep, or click the Loot All button at the bottom to loot everything.<br>You can also hold the [Ctrl] key while right-clicking the corpse to loot all items at once.</p>
<p><strong>Buying and Selling to a Merchant:</strong><br>To interact with a merchant, right-click on them while standing nearby.<br>To sell an item, click on an item in your inventory, or click on an item in the merchant’s inventory to buy it.<br>Press the Buy or Sell button, depending on what you want to do.<br>For stackable items, you’ll be prompted to select the quantity you want to buy or sell. Use the arrows to adjust or type the number directly in the quantity box.</p>
<p>To buy/sell a full stack, hold [Shift] while left-clicking the Buy or Sell button.<br>To buy/sell a single item from a stack, hold [Ctrl] while left-clicking the Buy or Sell button.</p>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong><br>The price the merchant lists is per item in a stack.<br>The merchant will inform you if you don’t have enough money to purchase something or if they have no interest in an item you wish to sell.</p>
<p><strong>Currency Conversion:</strong><br>1 Platinum = 10 Gold = 100 Silver = 1000 Copper</p>

<h3>3.0 Camping and Logging Out</h3>
<p>When you are not actively playing, your character does not require food, drink, or rest. Any conditions your character was in (such as being tired or hungry) will persist when you log back in. Additionally, your character will remain in the same location where you left the game.</p>

<h3>3.2 Chat Channels</h3>
<p>EverQuest supports up to ten player-created chat channels, in addition to the pre-existing channels. These channels are different from the in-game communication channels mentioned in section 2.2. Players can create their own channels, and a few permanent channels are provided by the game team. To communicate in these channels, you must join them and use the correct commands to send messages.</p>
<p><strong>Chat Channel Commands:</strong><br>/join channel name:channel password - Joins a chat channel.<br>/chat set channel1, channel2...channel10 - Join up to ten chat channels at once. This will overwrite any existing channels.<br>/#[text] - Sends a message to a specific chat channel (replace # with a channel number 1–10).<br>/autojoin channel1:password, channel2...channel10 - Automatically joins the specified channels when you log in.<br>/leave channel # - Leaves a particular chat channel.<br>/leaveall - Leaves all chat channels you are currently in.<br>/list - Lists all the chat channels you are currently in.</p>

<p>You can chat to OOC by typing /ooc, this is a global channel that is integrated with discord's own ⁠⌨｜ooc channel.</p>
<p>You cannot leave the OOC channel at the moment, but you can send it to its own window and minimize it.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3.3 Chat Specific Commands</h3>
<p>Here are some commands to help you manage your chat experience:</p>
<p><strong>/channel [channel name]</strong> - Sets the default chat channel for the chat window you type it in. For example, typing /channel ooc sets the default channel to Out of Character (OOC). From then on, every message you type in that window will be sent as a shout. To view the list of available channels, type /channel with no arguments.</p>
<p><strong>/tell [Charactername]</strong> - Sends a private tell to the specified character.</p>
<p><strong>/msg [Charactername]</strong> - Same as the /tell command; sends a private message to the specified character.</p>

<p><strong>/yell</strong> - Sends a yell for help to those within a short radius of you. Typically used when you are in need of assistance.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3.4 Combat Specific Commands</h3>
<p>These commands are essential for managing combat and related actions:</p>
<p><strong>/assist [TARGET]</strong> - If your target is within 200 feet, this command automatically targets whoever that character is targeting. Great for group combat situations where everyone focuses on the same target.</p>
<p><strong>/assist ON/OFF</strong> - By default, when you use /assist, auto-attack turns on. This command toggles auto-attack on or off based on your preference.</p>
<p><strong>/attack</strong> - Turns attack mode on or off.</p>
<p><strong>/autosplit ON/OFF</strong> - Automatically splits coins you loot with party members when turned on.</p>

<p><strong>/loot</strong> - Allows you to loot a corpse from a short distance (corpse must be targeted).</p>
<p><strong>/stopsong</strong> - A Bard-specific command that stops the bard’s song. This is useful in a hotkey setup.</p>
<p><strong>/stopcast</strong> - Instantly stops casting a spell. This is useful in a hotkey but doesn’t work while mounted.</p>

<h3>3.5 Communication</h3>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong><br>The default chat setting is /say.<br>Please refrain from using inappropriate language in any chat channels.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3.6 The Consider (/Con) System</h3>
<p>The /Con system helps you assess the difficulty of an opponent. To use it, right-click on your target or left-click on them and type /con. You'll then see one of the following colored messages in your chat window, indicating the relative difficulty of the target:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gray: This target is significantly below your skill level and offers no experience.</li>
  <li>Green: This target is below your skill level and offers reduced experience.</li>
  <li>Blue: This target is somewhat below your skill level.</li>
  <li>Dark Blue: This target is an adequate challenge and offers an experience bonus.</li>
  <li>White: This target is an equivalent challenge and offers an experience bonus.</li>
  <li>Yellow: This target is more skilled than you and offers an experience bonus.</li>
  <li>Red: This target is far more skilled than you and offers an experience bonus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: These challenge levels are designed assuming you'll be in a group at higher levels. As your character gains levels, NPCs that /con the same will become greater challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Prismatic Dye:</strong> On The Heroes' Journey, you can obtain Prismatic Dye from the Mischievous Halfling in the casino, which works as a dye reagent. You can also buy these from other players in the Bazaar.</p>

<h3>5.2 Evolving Items</h3>
<p>Evolving Items are a special category of items that improve and change over time based on your use. These items grow stronger as you kill monsters and gain experience, much like your character does!</p>
<p><strong>How to Identify Evolving Items:</strong><br>To check if an item is evolving, right-click and hold on the item in your inventory.<br>Look for the Evolving status line, which will display the item’s current level and experience progress towards the next level.</p>
<p><strong>How Evolving Items Gain Experience:</strong><br>Evolving Items gain experience as you kill monsters.<br>The experience gained is bonus experience, meaning there is no loss of experience for your character.<br>In order for the item to gain experience, it must be equipped in your Power Slot (the designated slot for such items).<br>Items that are not bags or already legendary can evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution Process:</strong><br>Evolving Items level up in stages, just like a player:<br>Base item to Enchanted<br>Enchanted to Legendary</p>
<p>Every time the item gains experience and reaches the next level, you will receive a notification.</p>
<p><strong>Item Effects and Requirements:</strong><br>Some Evolving Items have effects that require a certain level to be used.<br>If you are not high enough level to use a new effect from the item, you will get a message indicating this.</p>
<p><strong>Transferring Experience Between Evolving Items:</strong><br>Some Evolving Items can transfer their experience to one another.<br>To do this, use the Consume Item ability (AA). This allows you to transfer experience from one item to another of the same type.<br>For example, Painbringer can be consumed to add experience to another Painbringer item. To do this:<br>Hold the item in your cursor.<br>Click the Consume Item AA from your shortcut bar.</p>
<p>This system adds a new layer of progression to your items, encouraging you to actively use and evolve them alongside your character’s growth!</p>
<hr>
<h3>5.3 Experience</h3>
<p>In EverQuest, gaining experience is a crucial part of your progression. Here's a breakdown of how it works:</p>
<p><strong>Gaining Experience:</strong><br>Combat: The primary way to gain experience is by defeating monsters in the world of Norrath.<br>Quests: Completing quests also rewards you with experience points.</p>
<p><strong>Viewing Your Experience:</strong><br>To view your current experience and level progress, open your inventory by pressing the [I] key.<br>Your experience information is located beneath the "NEXT LEVEL" label on the left side of the inventory window.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the Experience Bar:</strong><br>The orange bar represents your progress toward the next level. As you gain experience, this bar fills up.<br>The blue bar in the center shows approximately 20% of your total experience required for the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Leveling Up:</strong><br>Once the orange bar reaches its end, your character will level up and become more powerful.<br>Hit Points (HP) increase, allowing you to survive longer in combat.<br>Mana (for casters) increases, letting you cast more spells.<br>Endurance improves, enabling you to perform more physical actions like running and using abilities.<br>Many skills can be raised as you level up, allowing you to improve your abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Leveling:</strong><br>Power increase: With every level gained, you become stronger overall, gaining more survivability, abilities, and potential to take on tougher challenges in the game.</p>
<hr>
<h3>5.4 Extended Target Window</h3>
<p>The Extended Target Window in EverQuest expands your ability to track multiple targets at once, making it a powerful tool for both group and raid situations.</p>
<p><strong>How to Access:</strong><br>Click the EQ button on your UI.<br>Navigate to the 'Actions' tooltip.<br>From there, you'll find the Extended Target Window.</p>
<p>By default, the slots in the Extended Target Window are automatically filled with NPCs (or enemies) that are attacking you or your group/raid members. However, you can customize these slots to show whatever targets you wish.</p>
<p><strong>Targeting in the Extended Target Window:</strong><br>Primary Target: You can click on any of the targets in the Extended Target Window to make it your primary target, as long as it is within targeting range.<br>Customization: Right-click on any slot in the window to access various customization options.</p>
<p><strong>Useful Features and Slots:</strong><br>Puller's Target: This shows the target of your group's designated puller. It’s useful for pre-targeting the incoming NPCs before they get close.<br>Group Assist's Target: This slot shows the target of the group member who is designated as Group Assist.<br>Target's Target: This slot shows the target of your current target. If your target is an NPC, it will show who the NPC is targeting.</p>
<p><strong>Why Use the Extended Target Window:</strong><br>It allows you to track multiple targets simultaneously.<br>Helps with coordinated efforts.<br>Can help you stay aware of what enemies are targeting.</p>

<h3>6.0 Feedback Commands</h3>
<p>On The Heroes' Journey, Feedback Commands are unsupported. Instead of using these commands to report issues or give feedback in-game, players are encouraged to reach out directly to a guide on Discord for in-game assistance or to report problems.</p>
<p><strong>How to Get In-Game Assistance:</strong><br>Contact a Guide on Discord: For any issues or inquiries, reach out to a guide via Discord for help. This ensures you get the support you need directly from the community or staff team.</p>
<p>While in-game feedback commands may be unavailable, Discord remains the primary channel for communication with staff and guides.</p>
<hr>
<h3>6.1 Fellowships</h3>
<p>On The Heroes' Journey, Fellowships are currently disabled. Although the fellowship window is still accessible in the game, it is not functional at this time. There are no active fellowship features, and the ability to form or join a fellowship is not available.</p>
<p>This may change in the future, but for now, players will not be able to use fellowships. Keep an eye out for updates, as this feature could be enabled at a later time.</p>
<hr>
<h3>6.2 Food and Drink</h3>
<p>Food and drink play a vital role in maintaining your character's well-being on The Heroes' Journey. If you fail to keep a moderate supply of food and water, your character will experience negative effects such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hungry:</strong> "You are hungry."</li>
  <li><strong>Thirsty:</strong> "You are thirsty."</li>
</ul>
<p>Without food and drink, your character will no longer regenerate health, mana, or stamina, which can severely hinder your ability to continue adventuring.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong><br>Automatic Consumption: Your character will eat and drink automatically as long as they have food and drink in their inventory. The character will automatically consume the first food and drink items in your inventory, from left to right and top to bottom.<br>Force Consumption: To force your character to eat or drink a specific item, right-click on the food or drink in your inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong><br>Stat-Increasing Foods: Some food and drink will temporarily increase stats like health or stamina. These effects will only apply if the stat-boosting food or drink is the first item in your inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Special Notes:</strong><br>Alcohol: Alcohol does not count as a sustaining drink and will not be consumed automatically to quench thirst. It must be consumed manually by right-clicking on it.</p>

<p><strong>Group Commands:</strong><br>/invite CHARACTERNAME: Invites the specified player or your current target to join your group. This can only be executed by the group leader.<br>/disband CHARACTERNAME: Allows a character to leave the group.

<p><strong>Looking for Group (LFG):</strong><br>/lfg on: Toggles a flag next to your name, signaling to others that you're looking for a group. This flag will show up in the /who command and above your character's nameplate. You can also check for others with the LFG flag and invite them to your group.</p>

<p><strong>Teleporting Group Members:</strong><br>As a group leader, you may also have the ability to teleport group members using the Bazaar and Back AA abilities, which can be helpful for quickly moving around zones and dungeons.</p>
<p>By grouping, you not only get stronger through collaboration but also have the opportunity to make new friends and connections.</p>

<p>The /who command is a very useful tool that allows you to see who is online within specific search parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Usage:</strong><br>Type /who in the chat bar and hit enter to see everyone currently in your zone.</p>
<p><strong>Worldwide Search:</strong><br>Use /who all to search beyond your current zone.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>/who all necromancer — Lists all necromancers in the world.<br>/who all 5 — Lists all level 5 characters.<br>/who all 5 10 — Lists all characters between levels 5 and 10.<br>/who all cleric 3 — Lists all level 3 clerics.<br>/who all "Guild Name" — Lists guild members for "Guild Name" (quotes required).<br>/who all Maddoc — Returns any character whose name begins with "Maddoc."</p>
<p>If the list is too large, it may cut short. Characters who are anonymous or role-playing will not appear in your search unless they are in your zone.</p>
