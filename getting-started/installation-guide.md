## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

If you are looking to set up your EQ Client to access THJ follow the steps below.

1.  You will first need an [_EQ Emulator account_](http://www.eqemulator.org/)
    1.  Once that is complete, create a [_login server account_](http://www.eqemulator.org/account/?CreateLS) Note: If you do not leave ‘receive emails from administrators’ checked, you will never receive the activation email for the forum account. Additionally, there have been some reports of Gmail accounts never receiving the activation email.
2.  Obtain RoF2 Client
    -   DirectX 9: Install [_DirectX 9_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) (required even if you have a newer version).
    -   Add EverQuest to Steam: Add it to your library but [_do not download it_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/205710/EverQuest/).
    -   Then you can use [our Installer](https://github.com/The-Heroes-Journey-EQEMU/thj-launcher/releases/download/v1.0.5/THJInstaller-1.0.5.zip) to install the game AND patcher, or continue with the manual install guide below!
        -   You just have to unzip it, and run it!
    -   Open Steam Console: Press **Win + R**, type **steam://open/console**, and press OK.
    -   Download Depot: Paste the following command in the Steam console and press Enter:
        -   **download\_depot 205710 205711 1926608638440811669**
    -   Find the Files: After the download complete message, locate the files at **%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Steam\\steamapps\\content\\app\_205710\\depot\_205711**.
    -   Move and Rename: Copy the **depot\_205711** folder to C:\\Games\\ and rename it (e.g., 'TheHereosJourney).
3.  Finally, download our patcher.

-   [**Download heroesjourneyeq.exe from releases**](https://github.com/The-Heroes-Journey-EQEMU/eqemupatcher/releases)
-   Right-click the download, go to properties, and check Unblock. Then click OK.
    -   *You may get an error from your AV about this file; there is no virus, but files that download other files look a lot like viruses to an AV*
-   Move heroesjourneyeq.exe to where ever you unpacked the RoF2 client, and run it.
-   Choose Patch, and allow all files to download.
-   Click Play to start.

4.  Play! - Remember that The Heroes’ Journey begins with the letter T in the server list.
