> Some reminders, tips, and tricks to help in **your** Heroes' Journey experience.

## 1) Sympathetic Items – Big Boosts to Damage & Healing

Sympathetic effects provide significant bonuses to both **damage** and **healing**. Here are some highlights:

-   **Tutorial Ring:** Gains *Minor Sympathetic Strike* once it becomes **Legendary**.
-   **Pal/Clr Summoned Hammers:** Come with *Sympathetic Healing I*.

### Farmable Sympathetic Items (1–50)

-   **Sacrificial Dagger (Strike II):**  
    \- Dropped in Mistmoore from a demon near the GY/crypt area (PH involved).  
    \- *Alternative:* Mithril Quill in SolA’s gnome castle area.
-   **Fine Steel Warhammer (Heal II):**  
    \- Ideal if dropped as Legendary, but any version is still worth watching for.
-   **Black Tome with Silver Runes (Strike III):**  
    \- Dropped by Frog Tactician in LGuk (live side, King room).  
    \- Likely the easiest Strike III item in Classic.
-   **Prayer Shawl (Healing III):**  
    \- Supposedly drops from Estrella in Kedge. (*Unconfirmed*).

**Pro Tip:** Use *RetributionEQ Alla* to search for items and effects. On the Ret server, “Apocryphal” = “Legendary.” Items must be **Apoc/Legendary** to gain special effects like Sympathetic Strike.

For this server, you can use a fan-made site: [THJ DI](https://www.thjdi.cc).   
Example item link: [https://www.thjdi.cc/item/2013400](https://www.thjdi.cc/item/2013400)

## 2) Skill Leveling + Sympathetic Items Synergy

To maximize synergy between skill leveling and sympathetic items:

1.  **Spam low-level spells (Lvl 1-ish)** as you go:
    -   Adds extra damage.
    -   Keeps your spell skills and channeling high.
2.  **Equip sympathetic items** to benefit from extra damage/healing procs *and* keep skills up.

## 3) Bags – A Must-Have for Capacity & Weight Reduction

Bags **cannot** be upgraded in the power slot, but **Enchanted/Legendary** bags often have:

-   Increased capacity
-   Weight reduction (WR)

### LGuk Farming Options

-   **Supplier Bags:** not lore; farm multiple.
-   **Evil Eye Bags:** also not lore; grab as many as you can.

**Pro Tip:** If you’re leveling in LGuk (any side), kill these mobs regularly to pick up extra bags.

### Bazaar Vendor Option

There’s a bag vendor in the Bazaar selling **super cheap 20-slot large bank boxes**. Stock up for more storage!

## 4) Bazaar NPCs of Note

### Spell Vendors/Trainers

-   Located on the **north side** of the Bazaar.
-   Offer spells up to **Level 50** (with a few exceptions).
-   **Tip:** Buy spells in bulk for multiple level ranges (10–25, 25–40, etc.).

### Tearel (Teleport NPC)

-   Hail Tearel, choose a destination, then *click the map* to teleport.
-   **Pro Tip:** Look for **glowing stones** while exploring to unlock more teleport options.

### Vision of Ayonae (Class Reset NPC)

-   Found on the **east side** of the Bazaar.
-   Allows you to remove one class to add another.
-   **Cooldown:** 15–30 days (TBD after launch).
-   **Cost:** Requires *Essence of Might (EoM)*.

### SW Bank NPCs

-   **Parcels NPC:** for mail/parcel service.
-   **Fading Memory Quest NPC:** for a specific quest line.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does Starting Faction work?

-   Based on **class, race, and deity**.
-   Affects guard KOS status and epic quest progression.
-   **Recommendation:** Choose Agnostic if possible.
-   If you plan a specific trio of characters, pick your race first; go Agnostic if available.

### How does Item Leveling work?

1.  Only items in the **Power Slot** receive XP.
2.  **Bags and Augs** do not level.
3.  If you can’t equip it, you can’t level it.
4.  Once an item gains XP, it becomes **NO TRADE**.
5.  Item leveling does not reduce your personal XP gain.
6.  **Leveling speed:**
    -   More stats = slower leveling.
    -   Sympathetic items take even longer.
    -   Approx. 4x Regular = 1x Enchanted, 4x Enchanted = 1x Legendary.
7.  Use the *“Consume Item”* AA to handle extra items — it’s essential!

### Lore/No Drop on Items?

-   Many items normally flagged **No Drop** or **Lore** are **tradeable** here.
-   Includes many **epic quest** drops — good for pre-Kunark farming.
-   **Pro Tip:** Sell or give away Phinny drops you don’t need!
-   Equipping normal/enchanted gear **doesn’t attune** it unless:
    -   You *use a clicky* on it, or
    -   You *kill a monster* with it in the **Power Slot**.

### Options for Faction Issues/Turn-ins?

-   **Sneak** (without Hide) behind an NPC to become indifferent.
-   **Feign Death (FD)** can help with turn-ins similarly.
-   **Legendary Masks** (e.g., *Mask of Deception* from LGuk assassin) become All/All, useful for:
    -   Fixing faction problems.
    -   Bypassing locked doors.
