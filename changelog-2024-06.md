Vah Shir, Iksar, Beastlords and Berserkers are now available for ALL players regardless of expansion unlock.
Progress with who you want!

Rogue Epic no longer completable in Classic. Congratulations on the feat and thank you for being so agreeable Pointz the Assassin! His Epic will be returned to him as soon as Kunark launches.

SK 51 AA was pointing to the wrong spell file. It was doing too much up front mana regen and was missing its recourse. Fixed on next patch.

Pending Patch:

A number of small but effective changes have been made to allow for a more diverse spread in the three man set up for early progression.

Calliav Line available to MAG, NEC, and BST- Mana cost halved. Casting time halved. Cooldown halved.
Magician Sol Ro pet items (Pet Power 5) now effect level 29-49 pets in a more noticeable way.
Magician Planar pet items (Pet Power 10) now effect level 49-60 pets in a more noticeable way.
Necromancer Epic and Encyclopedia Necrotheurgia added Minion of Hate effect now has a more noticeable effect on Emissary of Thule and Invoke Death

ALL MAGE PETS from level 29+ can benefit from Pet Power in a similar way of the custom epic pet does.
Earth pets will have the same HP and AC as the epic pet while the fire pet will match the epic pets damage (matches at each pet power rank while using the appropriate pet). Water and Air will be between both but keep their unique procs/abilities/casts.

This reduces the necessity of completing the mage epic and compensates for pet power draughts.

Velious drop Essence of Nature (Tunare) now has the Summoner's Boon focus (Pet Power 15). This change serves to fill the gap in pet power between Kunark and Luclin for Necromancers and Magicians as both can now be effected by Pet Power 15.

BST Pet Spirit of Omakin has been put on Vocarate Water drop table.
BST Pet Spirit of Zehkes put on Greater Vocaration Water drop table.
BST Pet Spirit of Khurenz put on Klandicar, Zlandicar, Wuoshi, Velketor, Kelorek, Sontalak, Master of the Guard, Tormax, and Dain
BST Pet Spirit of Khati Sha stays in Luclin

All of these four pets have had stats adjusted based on Mage/Necro pet power updates.

BST AA Bite of the Asp RK1 now does 25 damage per tick base, but scales 1 damage per level.
BST AA Chameleon Strike RK1 now does 25 base damage, but now has RK2 available at 51 for an increased base damage.

MNK AA Imitate Death now has a base 12minute CD with each rank of Hastened Death removing 2 minutes from the CD, max rank resulting in no CD. It now costs 50 Endurance.

Chloroblast level requirement changed for RNG/BST to 59.

Stacking issues with Warrior AA Infused by Rage fixed.
Blood of Ssra is now a unique spawn and should no longer double spawn sometimes.
Items no longer delete from your cursor when zoning
Urthron's Ultimate Unattuner now works again.

Minotaurs in Steamfont no longer hoard gems.
