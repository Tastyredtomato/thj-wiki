# Planes of Power

**With the launch of Planes of Power, thanks to one of our team members, Lachadan,** Players can now access **detailed expansion and progression guides in-game** by pressing `Alt+N` to open the **Storyline** window. This provides a structured view of **Planar Progression** and key information needed for advancing through **The Planes of Power**.

---

## **Overview of Planar Progression**
Planar progression follows a mostly **linear path**, requiring players to complete encounters in a structured order to advance through the tiers. While there are multiple ways to progress, the following **tiers** represent the **most direct path** with minimal need for "flag fixing."

> If you encounter **out-of-order flags**, refer to the **Storyline** window for guidance on resolving them.

---

## **Tier 0 – Pre-Work (Plane of Knowledge)**
- Players should locate **Gram Dunnar** in the **Plane of Knowledge** and say **"craft"** to receive an **Intricate Wooden Figurine**.  
- Each class will receive a specific version of the figurine.  
- Returning to **Gram** after major progression milestones grants **AA XP** and enhances the **Figurine’s stats**.

---

## **Tier 1 – Initial Planes**
Players will begin their planar journey by **defeating key bosses and completing trials** in the following planes:
- **Plane of Disease**
- **Plane of Justice**
- **Plane of Innovation**
- **Plane of Nightmare**

These zones serve as the foundation of **Planar Progression**, leading into the mid-tier encounters.

---

## **Tier 2 – Mid-Level Planes**
- **Ruins of Lxanvom (Crypt of Decay)**
- **Plane of Torment**
- **Plane of Storms**
- **Plane of Valor**

These planes introduce **stronger enemies and multi-step progression mechanics**, setting the stage for **higher-tier elemental encounters**.

---

## **Tier 3 – High-Level Encounters**
Progressing through this tier will unlock the **Elemental Planes**:
- **Torden, Bastion of Thunder**
- **Halls of Honor**
- **Temple of Marr**
- **Drunder, Fortress of Zek (Plane of Tactics)**
- **Tower of Solusek Ro**

Completion of these encounters is **required** before players can enter the **Elemental Planes**.

---

## **Tier 4 – Elemental Planes**
- **Doomfire, the Burning Land (Plane of Fire)**
- **Eryslai, the Kingdom of Wind (Plane of Air)**
- **Reef of Coirnav (Plane of Water)**
- **Vegarlson, the Earthen Badlands (Plane of Earth A)**
- **Ragrax, Stronghold of the Twelve (Plane of Earth B – The Rathe Council)**

The **Elemental Planes** feature **the most difficult encounters leading up to the final challenge**.

---

## **Tier 5 – The Plane of Time**
- **Quintessence of Elements (Plane of Time Access)**
- **Plane of Time**

The **Plane of Time** is the final stage of Planar Progression, offering some of the **toughest raid content and best rewards** in this expansion.

---

## **Final Notes**
For **detailed walkthroughs**, encounter strategies, and flagging fixes, **press `Alt+N` in-game** to open the **Storyline** window. This will provide a **full breakdown** of progression, including required tasks and flagging information.
