<li>Corrected Literally Unplayable typo in <code>/pet health</code> output</li>
<li><code>/pet health</code> aliases added -&gt; <code>/pet stats</code> <code>/pet inventory</code> etc</li>
<li>Added <code>/pet assist</code> command (on\off toggle available). When this mode is enabled, pet will follow owner's autoattack &amp; damaging spell targets, as well as automatically assist any pet with <code>taunt on</code> if the assisting pet has <code>taunt off</code></li>
<li>Added popup stats window to <code>/pet health</code> output</li>
<li>Added chat inventory output to <code>/pet health</code></li>
<li>Added support for some multi-word pet commands; notably <code>/pet get lost</code></li>
<li>Pet taunt and aggro generation revised.
<ul>
<li>Pet taunt always succeeds to put them at the top of hate list (with a smaller buffer than players get from the Taunt skill, which can fail)</li>
<li>Pets with<code>taunt on</code> inherit ALL of their owner's aggro (before aggro-reduction modifiers), and having a pet in this state reduces their owner's aggro by 50%.</li>
<li>Net result is that solo players will not take aggro from mobs as long as their tank pet is alive, and grouped players will not have perfect aggro on their tank pet (but can generate enough aggro cumulative with the tank pet to make pet tanking in groups viable)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pet Illusions survive zoning</li>
<li>Petamorph wands can target individual pets.</li>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Catapultam</p>
<p><strong>Auto AFK</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why this Change?</strong> Part of what we see in a critical hub zone such as Bazaar, is extremely high CPU, lag, causing a bad experience for other players trying to zone into the zone and function at all. This change aims to drastically reduce packet spam in the zone, keeping the zone lean and leading to a much better player experience when using the Bazaar. When a player with 4 pets is running in circles in the zone, it sends enormous amounts of position updates to X number of players in the zone, even those who are idle and don't need all of these updates.</p>
<p>When clients go AFK they stop receiving packet updates for movement. When they go un-AFK they get synchronized with all the clients around them.</p>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When in a non-combat zone (Bazaar) - auto AFK timer is 60 seconds</li>
<li>When in a combat zone - auto AFK timer is 10 minutes</li>
<li>When you go AFK, we also toggle the native /afk flag on the client now</li>
<li>When a client initiates a trade with another client, both clients in the trade get auto-marked as non-AFK</li>
<li>When a client finishes a trade with another client, both clients in the trade get auto-marked as non-AFK</li>
<li>Heading now takes part in triggering when a client "moved" to remove them from auto AFK status</li>
<li>Client messaging is now simply "You are AFK." / "You are no longer AFK."</li>
</ul>

* Needs CLIENT UPDATE (PATCH) *

<p>4/2/2025 (Yes, this one is real)</p>
<pre class="prismjs line-numbers" v-pre="true"><code class="language-">- Reverted class deletions. Implemented &lt;&lt;# a u t o s k i l l&gt;&gt; instead
  - Initially supports the following Skill attacks
      Backstab
      Bash
      Tiger Claw
      Eagle Strike
      Dragon Punch / Tail Rake
      Flying Kick
      Round Kick
      Kick
      Frenzy
  - Absolutely no timer deconfliction is executed by the command, please only enable skills you want to be used.

- Implemented #attackmode
  - Rangers no longer display their bow by default. Any character can use #attackmode ranged to preferentially use their bow for autoattack and display

- Implemented #petcmd
  - Pet window buttons (and hotkeys created from them, or /pet commands) only send instructions to the 'active pet' (the pet displayed in the window)
  - 'Triple-pet' UI mod is not recommended, as it may be confusing as to which pet is 'active'
  - added #petcmd to send instructions to ANY pets (send commands by class name, etc)
  - Usage: #petcmd [attack, qattack, follow, guard, sit, stop, taunt (on\\off), hold (on\\off), ghold (on\\off), spellhold (on\\off), focus (on\\off), back, regroup (on\\off)] [all, mag, bst, nec, enc, shm, dru, brd, shd].
  - Any number of command and target verbs may be used at the same time, and in any order
  - /pet health and #petcmd health now display inventory for that pet

- Removed access to #mystats. On most servers, the inventory\player profile page is inaccurate and so mystats is needed. On this one, due to the unique nature of our technology, the inverse is true.

- Corrected bug which allowed creation of augmented items that were not usable in any slots.
- Syncrosatchels or equivalents will now consider slotted augments to determine which slot an item can be equipped into
- Splinters of Time which are not PRI\SEC\RANGE no longer require slotting into a weapon

- Aid Grimmel quest npc should be more responsive now.
- The rztwl event in plane of tactics should behave even more as expected, with failure timers removed.
- The Fennin event in plane of fire should now correctly resume when returning to the zone and no longer fails on timeout.
- Plane of Earth a ring events rewritten to be more resilient to zoning out. (Thanks Pippz)
- Echo added to Splitpaw
- Mortal Coil is no longer blocked by random clickies
- Villagers in HoHA are now tethered and will not run full marathons.
- 61-65 LDoN spells have been added to PoP parchment turn in rewards
- 50-60 LDoN spells have been added to Warders, Ancients, Lords and Ladies in Velious
- Mistakenly remaining GoD and OoW spells have been removed from PoK vendors *and* player spellbooks.
- Lvl 62 BST and lvl 63 Necro pet now correctly scale their level.
- The likelihood of finding weapon augments has increased on the Glamour NPC.
- Aspect of the Reptile duration has been increased.
- /shield now works for Warriors level 30 or greater

<li>Forlorn Follower of Erollisi are <em>still</em> whatever their base NPC is. They still have the same quests, scripts, etc. If you need them to <em>die</em> for some event to work correctly, just kill them, don't use their dialogue to make them depop.</li>
<li>Echo of Power is not a direct 1:1 comparison to the effects of the old buffs, and may be adjusted in the future. The application of buff scaling makes the consolidated buff scale a little bit differently than the composite buffs.</li>

<pre class="prismjs line-numbers" v-pre="true"><code class="language-">New:

- Pets use equipped weapon delay instead of standard NPC delay.

<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<pre class="prismjs line-numbers" v-pre="true"><code class="language-">- Implemented experimental change to fix the 'no cast bar' bug. This MAY reintroduce a worse bug, but looks good in brief testing. Please report any instances of randomly not being able to cast or perform certain other activities.
- All starting AA now cost 0 points; this may cause your current 'spent' AA total to decrease when it is next updated.
- Significantly reduced the complexity of checking for bard song auto-refresh
- Poisons are no longer equippable.
- Removed several remaining class checks on epics.
</code></pre>
<p>New Features</p>
<pre class="prismjs line-numbers" v-pre="true"><code class="language-">- The Purveyor of Glamour will create Glamour-Stones (Transmog Ornaments) for Armor!
  - NOT Hero's Forge.
  - Works with modern &amp; legacy player models
  - 5Kpp + sacrificial item
  - Not Dyable

- Removed tradeskill recipe for Vial of Prismatic Dye
- Added Vial of Prismatic Dye to Augs merchant in Bazaar
- Adjusted Vial of Prismatic Dye pricing (Sell from vendor @ 50k, Buy from vendor @ 100p)

- The Purveyor of Glamour will now create 'Hero's Forge' style Armor Glamour-Stones!
  - Generated through 'custom work' randomization system
  - 2 EoM each, tradable.

- The Vision of Ayonae can now reset your AA!
  - Each character gets one free reset
  - Subsequent resets cost 10 EoM and incur a stacking 7 day cooldown (identical to dropping a class)

- Added Petamorph Wands: Wrulon, Phoenix (Red, Blue), Telmira, Stoneworker, Giant Ant, Gorilla, Crushbone Orc, Lightning Dervish, Lava Dervish, Stone Dervish
- Pets will spawn using the appearance of any equipped Petamorph Wands
</code></pre>
<p>The Vial of Prismatic Dye changes are likely going to be something that many people disagree with. We are choosing the take a different experience for armor appearance customization on this server vs official or other emulated servers. I feel that armor dyes are a 'quick and dirty' solution that allows getting whatever appearance you want quickly and easily, and removes a lot of the fun in finding the exact combination of gear to achieve the look you want. Transmog accomplishes this better, and serves as a plat sink that we definitely need. However, I am leaving Dyes in-game, for those who do want to use that shortcut, with an additional plat sink component.</p>
<p>Additionally, for those who do not want to deal with Heros' Forge armor appearances, please remember they can be disabled in the Options menu.</p>

Some of these are live, some of these are pending. Trying to iterate quickly to get all your reports addressed.

For a little background, things like this are not necessarily fixed in order of importance- beyond server stability and playability, every report is important.

So, when we have small amounts of time or limited capacity, we bite off little things.

Rest assured, our OCD will guarantee every report gets looked at 🙂

**Important Note:**

It has been decided that VP 2.0 launching with Kunark is a poor overall experience for a number of reasons.

VP moving forward will drop 1.0 loot and its bosses will be scaled back to fit in between Kunark progression targets and Velious dragons. They will keep most of their mechanics but the effects and stats have been reduced by about 60%.

This should make it feel like an end game Kunark experience, and with the availability of Enchanted/Legendary gear, still worth doing in era.

The mobs and abilities may be adjusted further.

Pending Patch:

**Discipline Timer Rework**

As you know shared timers between different class discs for melee and hybrid classes has been a huge hinderance in their expected cross performance.

A decision was made on how to make this work within the confines of the system.

After next patch:

ALL OFENSIVE DISCIPLINES, BETWEEN CLASSES, WILL NO LONGER SHARE A COOLDOWN.

Offensive disciplines that shared a cooldown WITHIN a single class, continue to share a cooldown.

ALL DEFENSIVE DISCIPLINES, BETWEEN CLASSES, WILL NOW SHARE A COOLDOWN. (All riposite Discs will share a timer, all dodge, parry, and damage reduction Discs will share a timer).

Defensive disciplines that shared a cooldown WITHIN a single class, continue to share a cooldown.

This will be a net increase in DPS for those stacking melee classes and a net decrease in certain mitigation combinations.

*Note: This is disciplines ONLY not AA.*

<ul>
<li>Not sharing a lot here, figure this one out yourselves.</li>
<li>This one is way better.</li>
<li>Items become no-drop as soon as you feed them XP.</li>
<li>Ok, fine. It's con and level based, totally independent of item stats. Relatively easy to get to enchanted, significantly harder to get legendary.</li>
<li>Harder at higher levels, but you can kill faster, so... evaluate that how you want.</li>
<li>Removed exact % feedback for leveling rate.</li>

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Echo of Luck now guarantees Apocryphal rewards for quests</li>
<li>Sympathetic Proc buffs now actually 16hr duration</li>
<li>Sympathetic Procs can trigger even if the spell cannot apply to a mob (ie, Symp Heal can proc even if the buff was blocked)</li>
<li>ST_SummonedPet handled correctly be implied targeting. (Petamorph wands)</li>
<li>Bards are no longer compelled to sing forever.</li>
<li>Fixed Berserkers not hitting more than 1x with Frenzy</li>
<li>Fixed Froglok Beastlord warders.</li>
<li>Familiar spells will no longer dismiss other types of pets when they fade.</li>
<li>Ikaav's Venom now has a spell icon.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="augmentation-overhaul" class="toc-header"> Augmentation Overhaul</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Augment Slots standardized across all items, into the following types;</p>
<ul>
<li>Type 1 (Stats): All equippable items have at least one of these slots. Augs with only stats will fit into these slots.</li>
<li>Type 2 (Worn): Equippable items without a focus or worn effect will have one of these slots. Augs wih a Focus or Worn effect, along with Type 1 augs, will fit in these slots.</li>
<li>Type 3 (Spells): Currently unused.</li>
<li>Type 4 (Procs): All Weapons have at least one of these slots. Augs with Procs, Damage, Bane Damage, Elemental Damage, or Type 3 augments will fit in these slots.</li>
<li>Type 20 (Ornament): All PRI\SEC\RANGE items will have one of these slots for statless ornaments.</li>
<li>Type 21 (Ornament): All Visible Slot equipment will have these slots (Currently unused).</li>
<li>Two-Handed weapons have an additional Type 1 and Type 4 slot compared to 1-handed items.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This should provide additional coherence to augment itemization, remove the relatively meaningless type 7\8 split, allow for items without foci\worn effects to be a little more valuable, and provide a much-needed boost to two-handed weapons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any augments in slots which are no longer valid will be ejected from items when this gets deployed, and will need to be reinserted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>** THJ ONLY**</p>
<ul>
<li>(THJ) AA can be activated while casting</li>
<li>(THJ) Items can be augmented even if it would result in an item that you can no longer use</li>
<li>(THJ) Fixed Archery procs.</li>
<li>(THJ) Fixed Reyfin Malakwa for Multiclass characters</li>
<li>(THJ) Items upgraded to Legendary via Power Source now correctly show as attuned.</li>
<li>(THJ) Legendary items may no longer be equipped in Power Source, and Enchanted-&gt;Legendary upgrades will eject the item from the Power Source instead of infinitely soaking XP<br>

On next patch:
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Echo of the Past added to The Howling Stones</li>
<li>Zerker AA Decap has had its damage reduced</li>
<li>Echo of the Past added to ChardokB</li>
<li>Echo of the Past added to Veksar</li>
<li>VP 2.0, ChardokB, and Veksar have had their items scaled down in anticipation of Kunark launch. VP 2.0 was done with the intent that end game Velious gear (NToV) outpaces it in most scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="prismjs line-numbers" v-pre="true"><code class="language-">For those of you new to the server,  balance changes are ongoing, both buffs and nerfs will happen to outliers. I try to lean toward buffs for others instead of nerfs for the one- but outliers have to be handled.

**Author:** Retribution EQ #change-log

</code></pre>
<p>Pending Patch:</p>
<p>A number of small but effective changes have been made to allow for a more diverse spread in the three man set up for early progression.</p>
<p>Calliav Line available to MAG, NEC, and BST- Mana cost halved. Casting time halved. Cooldown halved.<br>
Magician Sol Ro pet items (Pet Power 5) now effect level 29-49 pets in a more noticeable way.<br>
Magician Planar pet items (Pet Power 10) now effect level 49-60 pets in a more noticeable way.<br>
Necromancer Epic and Encyclopedia Necrotheurgia added Minion of Hate effect now has a more noticeable effect on Emissary of Thule and Invoke Death</p>
<p>ALL MAGE PETS from level 29+ can benefit from Pet Power in a similar way of the custom epic pet does.<br>
Earth pets will have the same HP and AC as the epic pet while the fire pet will match the epic pets damage (matches at each pet power rank while using the appropriate pet). Water and Air will be between both but keep their unique procs/abilities/casts.</p>
<p>This reduces the necessity of completing the mage epic and compensates for pet power draughts.</p>
<p>Velious drop Essence of Nature (Tunare) now has the Summoner's Boon focus (Pet Power 15). This change serves to fill the gap in pet power between Kunark and Luclin for Necromancers and Magicians as both can now be effected by Pet Power 15.</p>
<p>BST Pet Spirit of Omakin has been put on Vocarate Water drop table.<br>
BST Pet Spirit of Zehkes put on Greater Vocaration Water drop table.<br>
BST Pet Spirit of Khurenz put on Klandicar, Zlandicar, Wuoshi, Velketor, Kelorek, Sontalak, Master of the Guard, Tormax, and Dain<br>
BST Pet Spirit of Khati Sha stays in Luclin</p>
<p>All of these four pets have had stats adjusted based on Mage/Necro pet power updates.</p>
<p>BST AA Bite of the Asp RK1 now does 25 damage per tick base, but scales 1 damage per level.<br>
BST AA Chameleon Strike RK1 now does 25 base damage, but now has RK2 available at 51 for an increased base damage.</p>
<p>MNK AA Imitate Death now has a base 12minute CD with each rank of Hastened Death removing 2 minutes from the CD, max rank resulting in no CD. It now costs 50 Endurance.</p>
<p>Chloroblast level requirement changed for RNG/BST to 59.</p>
<p>Stacking issues with Warrior AA Infused by Rage fixed.<br>
Blood of Ssra is now a unique spawn and should no longer double spawn sometimes.<br>
Items no longer delete from your cursor when zoning<br>
Urthron's Ultimate Unattuner now works again.</p>
<p>Minotaurs in Steamfont no longer hoard gems.</p>

👀  What's that tag?

Hey Admins and Mods! Starting May 15, it's possible you might notice something new next to some of your members' usernames: ✨ **Guild Tags **✨

See a cute little tag next to a member's username or profile? That's a **Guild Tag**, which indicates someone's membership to a chosen Guild. You can click on this tag to see the Guild profile, and even apply for membership there as well. What this means for you, beloved Admins and Mods, is that if your server's AutoMod is on, it will also check for Guild Tags ☑️

**What's a Guild?** It's a small, exclusive server that members can apply to join. These servers are tight-knit communities where members can relish in shared identities, hobbies, play styles, and more!
&gt; Please note that Guilds are only available to a small number of servers at this time, so not every server has access to this experiment. Additionally, our support team cannot manually add servers to this experiment.

Much love,
The Discord Team
