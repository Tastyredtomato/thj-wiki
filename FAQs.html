<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1>
<h1>4K Upscaling: Lossless Scaling</h1>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/"><strong>Lossless Scaling</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Purchase and Install the App:</strong><br>Search for “Lossless Scaling” in the Steam store and purchase it. Install the app from your Steam library.</p>
<p><strong>Launch the App:</strong><br>Open the Lossless Scaling app from your Steam library. It will run in the background.</p>
<p><strong>Configure the App Settings:</strong><br>Within the app, you can customize settings like the scaling mode (integer scaling, FSR, Lanczos) and hotkeys. Choose the scaling mode that suits your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Launch Your Game:</strong><br>Set the game to a lower resolution than your monitor’s native resolution before scaling, so it can actually scale up.<br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/">Lossless Scaling on Steam</a></p>

<h1>Alternate UIs</h1>
<p><strong>Anyone got a UI that works?</strong></p>
<p>Sure do, check out ⁠<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1204418766318862356/1304678503693942875">THJ UI Stuff</a> &nbsp;or go to Options &gt; General Tab &gt; Load UI Skin to see what we have included with the patcher!<br>You can also visit <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1204418766318862356/1204418768185331763"><strong>#screenshots</strong></a> and check the pinned messages for other player-made UIs that might improve your experience.</p>
<p>If a UI works for the RoF2 client, it often works here. If it doesn’t, you may need some minor tweaks. Catapultam might help, but no guarantees!</p>
<hr>
<h1>Armor Models</h1>
<p>EverQuest has famously stable (and occasionally complicated) armor graphics. Here’s some info about enabling various textures:</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Velious Armors with Luclin Graphics</strong><br>If you want to use Velious textures with Luclin models, it’s technically possible but unsupported. It can cause crashes or artifacting. Use at your own risk!</p>
<p><code>LoadVeliousArmorsWithLuclin=FALSE</code></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Enabling Velious Armor for Classic Models</strong><br>Add the following to the <i>[Defaults]</i> section of eqclient.ini in your THJ folder. Make sure <code>LoadVeliousArmor=TRUE</code> is there as well:</p>
<p>LoadVeliousArmor=TRUE LoadArmor17=TRUE # Cloth LoadArmor18=TRUE # Ringmail LoadArmor19=TRUE # Scalemail LoadArmor20=TRUE # Leather LoadArmor21=TRUE # Chain LoadArmor22=TRUE # Plate LoadArmor23=TRUE # Monk LoadArmor240=TRUE # Customized Helmets</p>
<p>Each line above represents a specific armor type. Toggle individually if desired.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Obtaining Helmets with Custom Velious Graphics</strong><br>Certain helmets (Thurgadin, Kael, Skyshrine) have special Velious graphics. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2674">Thurgadin Helmets</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4296">Kael Drakkel Helmets</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4295">Skyshrine Helmets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure your “glamour stone” or ornament is the customized variant when buying or converting these!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The TIM Layer (Toggle Improved Models)</strong><br>Use <code>#tim</code> in-game to switch between classic and newer character models.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Classic Model Collection, Sponsored by Xackery</strong><br>Check out this <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1204418766318862356/1318635958303850576">discord channel</a> for additional tweaks and updates.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h1>Augments, what are they?</h1>
<p>Augments are like WoW gems—little pebbles you slot into gear. Some require specific slot types. Inspect your item to see the available slots, pick up the aug from your inventory, then drop it in to socket it.</p>
<p>You can buy basic weapon augments from the Aug merchant in the Bazaar, and dropped armor augs from other players. You <strong>cannot</strong> slot two of the same gem type into one weapon.</p>
<p>Buy a Perfected Augmentation Distiller from the aug merchant to remove augs from gear. Note that <strong>Augments do not bind to you</strong>; you can trade them between alts!</p>
<p><strong>Removing Augments:</strong><br>Purchase a Perfected Augmentation Distiller. Left-click the augment in your item, and it will prompt removal while the distiller is in your inventory.</p>

<h1>Basic Macros - Loot/Sell Macros</h1>
<h3>Loot Macro</h3>
<p>Bind a key to “target nearest corpse,” and also use a macro:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">/pause 5, /loot
/notify LootWnd LW_LootAllButton leftmouseup
/notify ConfirmationDialogBox CD_Yes_Button leftmouseup
</code></pre>
<p>Now pressing that key will both target the nearest corpse and loot it automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Sell Macro</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">/notify MerchantWnd MW_Sell_Button leftmouseup
/notify QuantityWnd QTYW_Accept_Button leftmouseup
</code></pre>
<p>Open the merchant window, click an item, press the macro to sell quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Destroy Macro</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">/notify IW_InvPage IW_Destroy leftmouseup
/notify ConfirmationDialogBox CD_YES_Button leftmouseup
</code></pre>
<p>Open your character page, pick up an item, press the macro. If you have confirmations off, you can omit the second line.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Bug Report</h1>
<p>NPC steal your items? NPC not there? NPC despawn? Quest broken? Spell Broken? Anything broken?</p>
<p>If you suspect a bug, please visit <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1204418766318862356/1301933112430825575"><strong>🔴｜in-game-bugs</strong></a> (Discord) and search to see if it’s already reported. If not, take a screenshot of the issue and open a new thread.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Buying Spells</h2>
<p><strong>Where do I buy spells?</strong></p>
<p>You can find trainers for every class in the Bazaar, selling spells up to level 50. Use your “Bazaar and Back” AA to get there, then locate your trainer. After 50, you’ll need to search /baz for dropped spells, or check Firiona Vie / The Overthere (Kunark). Necro and SK spells 51–60 can also be bought in Cabilis (Kunark). Some classes have alternative Iksar quest lines in Cabilis, too.</p>
<p>For certain older expansions, you can also check Rushkla Deklamoor in the EC tunnel.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Camera Views, Field of View, Viewport</h1>
<p>During gameplay, you can view your character from different camera angles, zoom in/out, or pan up/down. Press <strong>F9</strong> to cycle views.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First-person (default)</li>
  <li>Overhead (rotating)</li>
  <li>Rear (rotating)</li>
  <li>Overhead (fixed)</li>
  <li>Rear (fixed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Press <strong>F10</strong> to toggle the interface, useful for screenshots.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Field of View</strong><br>Use <code>/fov &lt;number&gt;</code> (45 to 90) to adjust your field of view. For example, <code>/fov 45</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Pan &amp; Zoom</strong><br><code>Alt + arrow keys</code> or right-click drag to move the camera. <code>F12</code> toggles mouse panning.</p>
<p>Useful keys:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Numpad 5/Home: Re-center</li>
  <li>Numpad 9/3 or PgUp/PgDn: Pitch up/down</li>
  <li>Numpad 7/1 or Insert/Delete: Zoom in/out</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Viewport Command</strong><br>EverQuest was designed for 4:3. Widescreens can cause vertical cropping. You can run the game in 4:3 or use <code>/viewport</code> to adjust.</p>
<p><strong>Example Viewport Settings:</strong><br><code>/viewport 171 0 1024 768</code> (768p)<br><code>/viewport 240 0 1440 1080</code> (1080p)<br><code>/viewport 320 0 1920 1440</code> (1440p)</p>
<hr>
<h1>Can’t find the file specified error?</h1>
<p>This usually indicates an incomplete download. Possible fixes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add exceptions for your antivirus—some might be interfering with downloads.</li>
  <li>Turn off real-time protection in Windows Security.</li>
</ol>
<p>Afterward, redownload the game.</p>
<p>Windows Security steps: <i>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Security &gt; Virus &amp; Threat Protection &gt; Manage Settings</i>. Toggle real-time protection Off, confirm, then re-download.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Cannot Unmem a Spell after Class Change</h1>
<p>If you changed classes and can’t unmemorize a spell (error: “none of your classes are eligible...”), speak to <strong>Ayonae, Composer of Fate</strong> in the Bazaar and say <code>unmem</code> to her. That will remove those spells from your gems.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Creating Item Links and Looking up Items</h1>
<p><strong>Can you link the (Legendary) Version of (Item)?</strong><br>From the Bazaar, use your <strong>Bazaar and Back</strong> AA, then type <code>/buyer</code> to open the Barter Buyer window. In the bottom-left search box, enter an item name and hit search to see if any version of that item is recognized.</p>
<p>For instance, if you have a base version of “Shield of the Immaculate” but want to see the Legendary version, simply search for it in /buyer. You might see listings or be able to link it even if you don’t own it physically.</p>
<p><strong>Linking Items in Chat:</strong><br>Shift + Left Click an item in your inventory or on a merchant to create a clickable link in chat. This also works in the #myskills or #mystats windows if they support linking.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Do berserkers get decapitate here?</h1>
<p>Nope! We improved <strong>Frenzy</strong> instead.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Do I share AA’s with alts?</h1>
<p>Nope! But you do earn AA at an increased rate on alts (Veteran experience). Check out the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1204418766318862356/1317702999480471552"><i>AA Veterancy Mechanism</i></a> for more details.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Do we have a wiki?</h1>
<p>Yes! <a href="https://wiki.heroesjourneyemu.com/">https://wiki.heroesjourneyemu.com/</a> is the official wiki—still a work in progress.</p>
<p>We also have a player-made wiki anyone can edit: <a href="https://theheroesjourney.wiki/">https://theheroesjourney.wiki/</a></p>
<hr>
<h1>Echoes of Memory</h1>
<p><strong>Echoes of Memory (EoM)</strong> are the donation “gift” currency you receive for supporting the server via Ko-Fi.</p>
<p>When donating, put your character name in the “name/nickname” box. The system automatically sends you EoM in-game once the donation processes!</p>
<p><strong>EoM also drop (rarely) from mobs</strong>—about 1,000 per day server-wide. You don’t loot them; they simply appear in your inventory if you’re the lucky killer.</p>
<hr>
<h1>EverQuest in Windowed Mode</h1>
<p>EverQuest can run full screen or windowed. Press <strong>ALT + ENTER</strong> to toggle.</p>
<p>You can also change this in the Options window via a toggle. Post-Omens of War, <strong>ALT + TAB</strong> works in full screen.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use external parsers like GAMParse or GINA, their overlays won’t appear in full screen mode.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Example In-Game Bug Report</h1>
<p><strong>Good Example:</strong><br>“I’m working on the Garzicor quest. The smithing recipe for ‘Chronium Plate’ is missing. I tried combining <i>Chunk of Chronium Ore + Forging Hammer + Water Flask</i> in a forge but it fails. Reference: <a href="https://www.thjdi.cc/item/2059">https://www.thjdi.cc/item/2059</a></p>
<p>Including quest/item/zone details and screenshots helps us fix the issue faster!</p>
<p><strong>Bad Example:</strong><br>“froglok king item stats are wrong.” (Which item? What stats should it have? Provide details!)</p>
<hr>
<h1>Example Tech-Support Post</h1>
<p><strong>Bad Example:</strong><br>“game won’t launch, my steam is broken!”</p>
<p><strong>Good Example:</strong><br>“Hi guys, when I launch the game, the patcher says ‘an error occurred while trying to start EverQuest. The system cannot find the file specified.’ After clicking OK, nothing happens. Here’s a screenshot. Thanks!”</p>
<p>We need specific messages, steps you took, and screenshots so we can help diagnose effectively.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Expedition/Dynamic Zones?</h1>
<p>An Expedition (or Dynamic Zone) is a unique instance of a zone for your group/raid. You can add/remove players freely.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Expedition Interface (Alt + Z)</strong><br>Shows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assigned Expedition (which zone you’re in)</li>
  <li>Leader name</li>
  <li>Members list</li>
  <li>Player count / max players</li>
  <li>Quit Expedition (1-minute timer to port you out)</li>
  <li>Outstanding Expedition Timers</li>
  <li>Leader Options</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Leader Options</strong><br>Affect the “Player Targeted” field:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add Player</li>
  <li>Remove Player</li>
  <li>Make Leader</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Expedition Commands</strong><br>Use <code>/dz</code> as shorthand for “dynamic zone”:</p>
<ul>
  <li>/dzHelp, /dzListTimers, /dzPlayerList</li>
  <li>/dzAddPlayer, /dzRemovePlayer, /dzMakeLeader</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>Forum Activation Email</h1>
<p>If your forum activation email never arrived, you can request another via: <a href="https://www.eqemulator.org/forums/register.php?do=requestemail">https://www.eqemulator.org/forums/register.php?do=requestemail</a></p>
<hr>
<h1>Getting Around</h1>
<p>To move around the world quickly, head to the middle building in the Bazaar and look for <strong>Tearel</strong> (the elf in purple). Target Tearel, press <strong>H</strong> to hail, and follow the menu options.</p>
<p>You can “attune the map” to different locations. Some teleports may cost EoM to unlock for your account. Then click the giant floating map by his head and pick “Self” or “Group” teleport.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Glamours for Weapons and Armor</h1>
<p>You can get cosmetic “glamour” items for weapons and armor by visiting the <strong>Purveyor of Glamour</strong> in the Bazaar (near the stables).</p>
<p><strong>Random Weapon Glamours:</strong><br>Give them 2 EoM for a random weapon glamour (could be anything from Rusty Sword to an Epic 2.0 look).</p>
<p><strong>Convert an Existing Item:</strong><br>Give the weapon or armor + 5,000 pp to the Purveyor to receive a glamour version of the same appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Cosmetic Items:</strong><br>For illusions and mounts, visit the <i>Gambling Halfling</i> near the East Bank in the Bazaar. 5,000 platinum or 2 EoM per gamble attempt.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Group Experience on THJ</h1>
<p>It’s split evenly among group members. However, each member’s personal modifiers (level bonus, AA bonus, potions, etc.) affect their final XP.</p>
<p>Order of operations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Base XP is gained.</li>
  <li>It’s split evenly among group members.</li>
  <li>Individual modifiers (AA count, level, potions) apply last.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h1>Having lag/stuttering issues in game?</h1>
<p>If your system can handle bigger games but EQ stutters, try the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Edit eqclient.ini</strong>: <code>CPUAffinity0 = -1</code> (use all CPU cores) <code>UseLitBatches = FALSE</code> (use your GPU a bit more)</li>
  <li><strong>NotCPUCores</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/rcmaehl/NotCPUCores/releases">Download here</a>. Let you manually set affinity for eqgame.exe and ensure all cores are utilized.</li>
  <li><strong>4GB Patch</strong>: <a href="https://ntcore.com/4gb-patch/">https://ntcore.com/4gb-patch/</a> Patch eqgame.exe for large address awareness. - There is a video on how to install <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1204418766318862356/1314594496427851856/1317721681942544386">here</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h1>Heroic Stats</h1>
<p>These are stats on Legendary items with a “+#” next to them. They can offer unique effects. For more info, see:</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.heroesjourneyemu.com/en/classes-and-abilities/heroic-stats">Heroic Stats Wiki</a></p>
<hr>
<h1>I want to make a trader!</h1>
<p>Head to <a href="http://www.eqemulator.org/account/?CreateLS">EQEmu forum</a> and create a second login account. Run the client again with this account to make a trader. If you leave the Bazaar, the trader disconnects. If you need multiple accounts for multiple people at your home, request an IP exemption from the Guides.</p>
<p>Use <code>/trader</code> in-game to begin. You’ll need <strong>trader satchels</strong>, must be standing in the trader stalls, and you set item prices in the pop-up window.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Incomplete Maps?</h1>
<p>If you enter zones like Halls of Betrayal or Dulak and find them blank, you can grab third-party maps. For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eqmaps.info/eq-map-files/">eq-map-files</a></p>
<p><strong>How to Install:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the ZIP file of the maps.</li>
  <li>Unzip the contents.</li>
  <li>Find your EverQuest folder, typically <code>C:\THJ if you followed the Getting Started</code></li>
  <li>Create <code>C:\THJ\maps\Brewall</code></li>
  <li>Copy the unzipped map files into that folder.</li>
  <li>Log into EQ, open your map window, and choose “Brewall” in the upper-left dropdown.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h1>IP Exemptions</h1>
<p>For an IP Exemption (to allow more than the normal limit of simultaneous logins from the same IP), see <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1204418766318862356/1341481810001133569"><strong>#ip-exemption</strong></a> in Discord. The process is partially automated.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Is the server down?</h1>
<p>Check <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1204418766318862356/1288875607509172234"><strong>#announcements</strong></a> in Discord or the <strong>@The Heroes’ Journey</strong> Discord bot status in the top-right corner. That typically shows who’s online and any known downtime.</p>
<hr>

<h1>Macro Items (/useitem command)</h1>
<p><strong>/useitem &lt;slot&gt; [subindex]</strong><br>Use this command to click items in specific slots (inventory or worn).</p>
<p><strong>Example: /useitem 16</strong><br>This clicks your right ring. Add <code>/pause 6, /useitem 16</code> in a macro to give it half a second to cast before the next line executes.</p>
<p>To click an item in a bag slot (bag #, position #), you do something like <code>/useitem 23 0</code> if it’s in bag slot 23, position 0. Bag slots count upward left-to-right, top-to-bottom.</p>
<p>Item Slot Codes: • Charm = 0 • Left Ear = 1 • Head = 2 • Face = 3 • Right Ear = 4 • Neck = 5 • Shoulders = 6 • Arms = 7 • Back = 8 • Left Wrist = 9 • Right Wrist = 10 • Range = 11 • Hands = 12 • Primary = 13 • Secondary = 14 • Left Ring = 15 • Right Ring = 16 • Chest = 17 • Legs = 18 • Feet = 19 • Waist = 20 • Power Source = 21 • Ammo = 22 • Bag 1 = 23 • Bag 2 = 24 • ... • Bag 10 = 32</p>

<h1>Sympathetic Strike/Healing</h1>
<p>There's ranks of the effect. All are clicky buffs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sympathetic heal ranks have varying minimum requirements for mana and spell level to trigger. Eg. Sympathetic heal 1 triggers from any beneficial (buff or heal) spell with a mana cost of 10 or above, but Symp Heal 4 requires level 30+ spell <i>and</i> 75+ or 100+ mana.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sympathetic Healing lists a minimum spell level for a required proc. Please remember <i>other classes</i> may get the spell at an earlier level than you and so for your class.. that spell might not proc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effect of this is an extra heal that scales based on the rank of the buff and your +healing stat (healing AAs also boost this). The extra heal will land on your current target when your triggering spell finishes casting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Symp strike requires minimum of 10 mana to trigger on a detrimental damaging spell (dot or DD) for all ranks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an extra nuke that lands when your triggering spell finishes casting. Damage increases with rank of the buff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a thread where its discussed, and a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1viwIXFigtKHnQIg8Cw5bSGN8cUQkbG3jGR1LRtE-WPQ/edit?usp=sharing">list of all the items</a>:&nbsp;</p>

<h1>THJ Install Commands</h1>
<h1>Steam Console Commands &amp; Steam Depots</h1>
<p>Several people have asked about the console commands and such we have to type in when getting the steam-depots, so here is a breakdown:</p>
<h2>The command <i>steam://open/console</i></h2>
<p>A Steam protocol link that, when run in the Windows “Run” window (Win + R), opens Steam’s built-in console. This console allows you to input various commands for debugging, downloading specific depot files, accessing hidden Steam settings, and other advanced Steam-related tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to Use It:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Press Win + R to open the “Run” dialog.</li>
  <li>Enter <code>steam://open/console</code> and press Enter.</li>
  <li>Steam will open, and you'll see a new Console tab in the client.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What You Can Do With the Steam Console:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Check hidden app info using commands like <code>app_info_print &lt;AppID&gt;</code>.</li>
  <li>Download specific game versions (useful for rolling back updates).</li>
  <li>Access hidden Steam settings.</li>
  <li>Monitor Steam logs and errors.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>The command: <code>download_depot 205710 205711 1926608638440811669</code></h2>
<p>Used in Steam’s console to manually download a specific version of a game’s files. Let’s break it down:</p>
<h3>Understanding the Command</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>download_depot</strong> → This is the Steam console command to download a specific game’s depot.</li>
  <li><strong>205710</strong> → This is the AppID of the game (in this case, Torchlight II).</li>
  <li><strong>205711</strong> → This is the DepotID, referring to a specific set of game files (e.g., base files, DLC, or a particular platform version).</li>
  <li><strong>1926608638440811669</strong> → This is the Manifest ID, corresponding to a specific version (patch/update) in that depot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Happens When You Run It?</h3>
<p>Steam will download the specific depot (game files) with that manifest version. The files will be stored in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Steam\steamapps\content\app_&lt;AppID&gt;\depot_&lt;DepotID&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Example path:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_205710\depot_205711
</code></pre>
<p>This does not replace your currently installed game files; you must manually copy/move them if you want to use them.</p>
<h3>Why Would You Use This?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Downgrade a game to an older version if a new update causes issues.</li>
  <li>Retrieve missing or deleted files without reinstalling the entire game.</li>
  <li>Extract specific game assets (for modding or debugging).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>Titles</h1>
<p><strong>Mob Slayer Titles</strong> (kill X of a mob type):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hunter: 500</li>
  <li>Slayer: 5,000</li>
  <li>Destroyer: 10,000</li>
  <li>Exterminator: 50,000</li>
  <li>Annihilator: 1,000,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gambler Titles</strong>: Awarded for gambling certain amounts or hitting rare jackpots.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>God-Slayer</strong>: Chance to get this by landing the killing blow on a god.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Event Titles</strong>: Earned through holiday events or Twitch events. Watch <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1204418766318862356/1288875607509172234"><strong>#announcements</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Easter Egg Titles</strong>: Hidden in various ways, you have to find them!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Tracking: Situational Awareness and Tune of Pursuance</h2>
<p>Both <i>Tune of Pursuance</i> and <i>Situational Awareness</i> add an <strong>invisible bonus</strong> to your Tracking skill—like +50 or +75 skill points. This doesn’t show in your character window or #myskills, but it is working.</p>
<p>For example, if your base Tracking is 175/175, and you get +75 from these AAs, the UI will still show 175/175, but you effectively have 250.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Tribute</h1>
<p><strong>Tribute - Temporary Personal Buffs and Focus Effects</strong></p>
<h2>What is Tribute?</h2>
<p>The Tribute system is active on THJ and available from Classic Era and onwards. This was added in the Gates of Discord expansion to allow players to sacrifice items or platinum in exchange for Favor. Players may then spend Favor to acquire various buffs, including focus effects, extra stats or AC, resists, and even the option to automatically resurrect upon dying.</p>
<p>Note that when you turn an item or platinum in for Favor that thing is lost forever as if you had destroyed it.</p>
<h2>How do I use Tribute?</h2>
<p>You will need to visit a Tribute Master to select what buffs you want and donate items for Tribute Points. The easiest tribute master to find is Aeyln D`sai, located in The Bazaar at the Shadowhaven side bank.</p>
<p>First, let's obtain some Favor. Select items that you do not want from your inventory and press Donate. This will consume the item and increment your Current Favor and Career Favor.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Your Current Favor</strong> is how much you have to spend on buffs. The active cost of your buffs will be subtracted from this value every 10 minutes while Tribute is active.</li>
  <li><strong>Your Career Favor</strong> is a cumulative representation of the total favor you have earned. This is not spendable, instead just a big number to show off.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will select some buffs that we want. Buffs come in tiers which have increasing costs and level requirements. As you upgrade a buff to a higher rank, it provides a stronger benefit. We'll select a buff from the Available Benefits tab and then press Upgrade to move it to our Active Benefits tab.</p>
<p>The last thing is for us to actually activate the Tribute and receive. The default keybind to pull up our Tribute window is Alt+U.</p>
<p>Press Activate and your buffs will turn on, subtract the current cost from your current favor, and then the 10-minute timer will count down. When the timer reaches 0, you will pay the active cost again and your buffs will keep running.</p>
<p>To deactivate our Tribute, we use the same Alt+U window and press Deactivate. This stops the clock, stops consuming our favor, and immediately takes away our buffs.</p>
<h2>How do I get items to donate for Tribute?</h2>
<p>A good rule for items is that if they're wearable, rare, and worth a lot of vendor platinum then they might Tribute for a lot. This rule can start to break down in later expansions when the platinum value of items decreases, but it gives you an idea of how to approach Tribute.</p>
<p><strong>Excellent zones for farming Tribute are:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Veksar</li>
  <li>Crypt of Nadox</li>
</ul>
<p>Because these are later zones, the items from these places do not have much vendor value, but some pieces can have extraordinary Tribute value for the difficulty in acquiring them.</p>
<p><strong>Decent zones for farming Tribute are:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sebilis (Kunark class armor, notably breastplates from Trakanon)</li>
  <li>The Hole (Loam visible pieces, the robe especially)</li>
  <li>Karnor's Castle (Kunark class armor, notably leggings from Venril Sathir)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips for getting the most out of your Tribute</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Carefully weigh the value of an item before you donate it. You can use Ctrl+Shift+Left Click to instantly search the Bazaar to see what an item might be worth to other players. It might Tribute for a lot, but it could also sell for a lot, too!</li>
  <li>If you find a good item to Tribute, consider checking the Bazaar to see if anyone is selling it for cheap. It might be easier to buy several items instead of going to farm them.|</li>
  <li>There may be certain instances where you can get away with using lower tier focus effects instead of the maximum. Improved Damage IV works on spells up to level 65. Improved Damage III works on spells up to 60.</li>
  <li>Try not to forget to turn your Tribute off if you don't need it anymore, or avoid going AFK overnight if you leave it on a lot. It will keep ticking and consuming your favor.</li>
</ul>
