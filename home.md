# **Welcome to The Heroes’ Journey Wiki**

<br>
<img src="/thjwebsitelogo.png" alt="THJ Logo" width="160" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
<br>

This is your chance to relive the adventures that shaped you, but with a twist: you are no longer bound to a single class path. Embrace **Seamless Multiclassing**, wielding the powers of up to three classes at once. Harness **thousands of AAs, spells, and disciplines**, forging your own legendary hero as you personally progress through each expansion. Along the way, seek out **Enchanted and Legendary** versions of your favorite gear, growing in strength with every step of your journey.

- **Seamless Multiclassing**

	Your Warrior was tanky, but why stop there? Be your own **holy trinity**, or adapt to fill any role your group needs.

- **Enhanced Loot**
		Your favorite pixels are here—now in three rarities of increasing power.

- **Class-Defining AAs**
		No more waiting four expansions for your class to shine. Every class starts with powerful AAs, letting you **immediately** fulfill your role.

- **Personal Progression**
		Expansions unlock not by timers, but by **your achievements**. Prove your worth and carve your own path forward.

- **Free Trade**
		That epic piece of gear? If you can’t use it, **trade it** for something you can.

- **Increased Spawn Rates**
		No more endless camping—**named spawns have been cut down to just over ten minutes**.

- **Discovery-Based Fast Travel**
		Uncover **shimmering rune circles** throughout the world and unlock the ability to teleport back with ease.

- **No Box, No MQ**
		No need to box—just you, your **epic class combinations**, and your friends.  
		No need for MQ either—your map has all the tools you need.

Your journey begins here. Will you rise to the challenge?

**Join us and forge your legend.**
