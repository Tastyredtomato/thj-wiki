# Berserker Class Overview

![](/berserker_page.png){.align-center}

## Introduction

> The Berserker class on **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** features several unique adjustments compared to Live servers. With **expanded skill access, enhanced damage abilities, and custom mechanics**, Berserkers are powerful melee damage dealers. This guide covers key differences, auto-granted AAs, skill progression, and combat disciplines.

Berserkers on THJ benefit from **expanded skill availability, powerful auto-granted AAs, and finely tuned melee disciplines**. Mastering these changes allows players to optimize **damage output, survivability, and group support** for maximum effectiveness.

## Berserker Skills

Berserkers receive all class skills **automatically at level 1**, increasing them through use. Some skills (e.g., *Hide*) may appear due to the serverâ€™s multiclassing system, but they cannot be used unless assigned at least one skill point.
