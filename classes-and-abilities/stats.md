# Stats Overview

## Introduction

All stats, with every AA-related bonus obtained (such as Planar Power), increase your stat cap to **380**. Heroic stats go beyond this cap. If the **base value** (excluding heroic bonuses) is below 380, normal stats will continue to provide benefits. This guide outlines how each stat impacts your character.
