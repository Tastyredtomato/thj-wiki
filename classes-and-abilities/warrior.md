# Warrior Class Overview

![](/warriorpage.png)

## Introduction

The Warrior class on **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** has been customized significantly from Live servers. With **shortened cooldowns, out-of-era AAs, and enhanced combat disciplines**, Warriors play an even stronger role as **tanks and melee damage dealers**. This guide covers key differences, auto-granted AAs, skill progression, and combat disciplines.

---

## Key Differences from Live

-   **Reduced Discipline Timers:**
    -   Most disciplines have cooldowns **under 15 minutes**.
-   **Expanded AAs:**
    -   Many **out-of-era AAs** are available in every expansion but balanced for THJ.
-   **Custom Warrior Epic 1.0** available upon **Kunark’s release**.

---

## Warrior Level 1 Auto-Granted AAs

### Brutal Discipline

-   Increases damage output but **reduces healing effectiveness** on the warrior.

### Rampage

-   Allows the warrior to **strike all enemies** in a small radius.

### Roar of Challenge

-   Periodically **infuses all foes with intense hatred** toward the warrior.

### Battle Frenzy

-   **10% chance per rank** to trigger after slaying a **non-trivial enemy**.
-   Instantly **restores some endurance** and **boosts offensive damage** for 30 seconds.

### Pinpoint Taunt

-   Has a chance to **provoke an enemy into continuing combat instead of fleeing**.

### Bazaar and Back Gate

-   **Cooldown:** 10 minutes.
-   Allows teleportation to the **Bazaar** when out of combat.

### Eyes Wide Open

-   Increases the capacity of the **extended target window**.

### Mystical Attuning

-   Increases the number of mystical effects that can affect you at once.

## Warrior Skills

Warriors receive all class skills **automatically at level 1**, increasing them through use. Some skills (e.g., *Bash* or *Mend*) may appear due to the server’s multiclassing system, but they cannot be used unless assigned at least one skill point.
