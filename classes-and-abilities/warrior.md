# ![Warrior](/classes-and-abilities/warrior.gif) Warrior Class 

> The Warrior class on **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** has been customized significantly from Live servers. With shortened cooldowns, out-of-era AAs, and enhanced combat disciplines, Warriors play an even stronger role as tanks and melee damage dealers. This guide covers key differences, auto-granted AAs, skill progression, and combat disciplines.

Warriors receive higher armor class and hitpoints from equipment in comparison to any other class. They also take 5% less damage from any melee attack.

Warriors on THJ benefit from **shortened cooldowns, custom combat disciplines, and powerful taunting abilities**. Understanding these mechanics will allow players to optimize their **damage output, tanking efficiency, and battlefield control** for maximum effectiveness.

## Warrior Skills

Warriors receive all class skills **automatically at level 1**, increasing them through use. Some skills (e.g., *Bash* or *Mend*) may appear due to the server’s multiclassing system, but they cannot be used unless assigned at least one skill point.

Note: Activating a Discipline will put all disciplines in the same shared cooldown group on cooldown.
