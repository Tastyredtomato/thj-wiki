# Beastlord Class Overview

![](/beastlordpage.png)

## Introduction

The Beastlord class on **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** has several unique mechanics compared to Live servers and other emulated servers. As a hybrid pet class, Beastlords benefit from additional flexibility in pet interactions and unique auto-granted abilities. This guide covers these differences, auto-granted AAs, skill progression, and disciplines.

---

## Key Differences from Live

-   **Pet Buffing:** Beastlord pets can receive buffs from all beneficial spells and abilities, including:
    -   Their own class spells
    -   Spells from additional selected classes (if multiclassed)
    -   Bard songs
    -   Some buffs do not fully stack (e.g., haste portions of *Necromancer Intensify Death* and *Magician Burnout*).
-   **Custom Beastlord Epic 1.0** is available once **Luclin** is released.

---

## Beastlord Level 1 Auto-Granted AAs

### Feral Strike

-   Strikes the opponent and reduces the hate generated by your attacks.

### Companion’s Blessing

-   Allows group beneficial spells to affect your summoned pets.

### Quickened Companion

-   Grants a faster-casting version of *Summon Companion*.

### Asp’s Bite

-   Imitates an asp’s bite, poisoning the target with a short but powerful venom.

### Group Shrink

-   Shrinks all nearby group members.

### Pet Hold & Greater Pet Hold

-   **/pet hold** command prevents the pet from attacking unless explicitly told to.
-   **Greater Pet Hold** ensures the pet does not add targets to its hate list unless commanded.
-   When an encounter is finished, the pet automatically returns to the hold state.

### Bazaar and Back Gate

-   **Cooldown:** 10 minutes.
-   Allows teleportation to the **Bazaar** when out of combat.

### Eyes Wide Open

-   Increases the capacity of the **extended target window**.

### Mystical Attuning

-   Increases the number of mystical effects that can affect you at once.

## Beastlord Skills

Beastlords gain all class skills **automatically at level 1**, increasing them through use. Some skills (e.g., *Kick*) may appear in the UI due to the server’s multiclassing system, but they cannot be used unless assigned at least one skill point.

### Resist Focus

-   Increases resistances for a short duration.

### Fear Immunity
