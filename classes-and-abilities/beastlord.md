# Beastlord Class Overview

![](/beastlordpage.png){.align-center}

## Introduction

> The Beastlord class on **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** has several unique mechanics compared to Live servers and other emulated servers. As a hybrid pet class, Beastlords benefit from additional flexibility in pet interactions and unique auto-granted abilities. This guide covers these differences, auto-granted AAs, skill progression, and disciplines.

Beastlords on THJ have a unique playstyle with expanded pet interactions and customized AAs. Understanding these differences and skill mechanics will help players maximize their potential. Experiment with disciplines, pet commands, and ability combinations to optimize your Beastlord experience.

## Key Differences from Live

- **Pet Buffing**: Beastlord pets can receive buffs from all beneficial spells and abilities, including:
  - Their own class spells
  - Spells from other classes (if multiclassed)
  - Bard songs
  - (Note: Some buffs do not fully stack, e.g. certain haste effects.)
- **Custom Beastlord Epic 1.0** is available once Luclin is released.

## Beastlord Level 1 Auto-Granted AAs

### Feral Strike
- Strikes the opponent and reduces the hate generated by your attacks.

### Companion’s Blessing
- Allows group beneficial spells to affect your summoned pets.

### Quickened Companion

### Asp’s Bite
- Imitates an asp’s bite, poisoning the target with a short but powerful venom.

### Group Shrink
- Shrinks all nearby group members.

### Pet Hold & Greater Pet Hold
- `/pet hold` command prevents the pet from attacking unless explicitly told to.
- Greater Pet Hold ensures the pet does not add targets to its hate list unless commanded.

### Bazaar and Back Gate

## Beastlord Skills

Beastlords gain all class skills automatically at level 1, increasing them through use. Some skills (e.g., Kick) may appear in the UI due to the server’s multiclassing system, but they cannot be used unless assigned at least one skill point.
