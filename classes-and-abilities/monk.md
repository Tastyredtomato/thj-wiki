# ![Monk](/monk.gif) Monk Class


> The Monk class on **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** differs significantly from Live servers. With **reduced ability cooldowns, expanded out-of-era AAs, and unique combat mechanics**, Monks are more versatile and powerful. This guide outlines the key differences, auto-granted AAs, skill progression, and disciplines.

Monks on THJ benefit from **shortened ability cooldowns, powerful custom AAs, and enhanced melee capabilities**. Understanding these mechanics will allow players to optimize their **damage, survivability, and crowd control abilities** for a highly effective playstyle.

## Monk Skills
