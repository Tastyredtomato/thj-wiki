# ![Druid](/druid.gif)Druid Class


> The Druid class on **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** has several key differences compared to Live servers and other emulated servers. Druids benefit from persistent buffs, expanded pet interactions, and unique auto-granted AAs. This guide covers these differences, auto-granted abilities, skill progression, and tradeskills.

Druids on THJ benefit from persistent buffs, pet versatility, and powerful auto-granted AAs. Understanding these mechanics will allow players to optimize their healing, damage, and pet utility for a well-rounded experience.

## Druid Skills

Druids receive all class skills **automatically at level 1**, increasing them through use. Some skills (e.g., *Mend* or *Remove Trap*) may appear due to the serverâ€™s multiclassing system, but they cannot be used unless assigned at least one skill point.
