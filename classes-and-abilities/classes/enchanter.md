### Enchanters in *The Heroes Journey*

**Enchanters** in *The Heroes Journey* diverge from traditional enchanters with a suite of unique abilities, many of which are atypically powerful due to their access to advanced, out-of-era Alternate Abilities (AAs). These enhancements equip them with versatile and formidable support tools, specializing in both offensive and defensive capabilities, to aid their allies and disrupt enemies.

- **Deep Sleep** – A potent debuff, Deep Sleep reduces the damage dealt by bosses, giving allies a crucial advantage in prolonged battles.

- **Mental Contortion** – This powerful damage-over-time (DoT) spell applies a similar damage reduction to bosses, offering sustained debuffing power over time.

- **Doppelganger** – With this AA, Enchanters summon a swarm pet that focuses single-target damage, adding an unexpected offensive layer to their traditionally support-oriented roles.

- **Illusions of Grandeur** – On a 10-minute cooldown, this AA significantly boosts the spell critical rate and damage for the entire group, amplifying team-wide performance during high-stakes encounters.

- **Mana Replenishment Abilities** – Enchanters also have several AAs that help them sustain mana, allowing them to contribute consistently throughout drawn-out fights.

- **Dire Charm** – An un-dispellable permenant charm ability that works on any light-blue charmable monster.

**Charming** has also been a large overhaul on The Heroes Journey where charm spells are more evenly distributed through the levels, charm breaks are less commmon, charm is refreshable on monsters, and the charm buff itself gives accuracy and mitigation to the charmed pet.

**Epic** quest exists with a more powerful custom version of the Enchanter Epic 1.0 {{<item id="20542" name="Staff of the Serpent" link="/equipment-guide/epics/enc-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

Once the encounter is finished, your pet will automatically go back to a held state.  If your pet is never to exclusively attack anything, your pet will never attack anything, even if something is attacking i t.

Skills are automatically granted at level 1 and improve through use, similar to mechanics on live servers. Some skills that Enchanters wouldn’t typically have, such as *Bash* or *Mend*, may appear initially, but they are not usable and are remnants of the server’s multiclassing framework. Usable skills require at least one skill point to activate.

An exception to this is *Tracking*, which starts with one skill point and allows players to view monster names on the map. While *Tracking* cannot normally be leveled through use, The Alternate Ability *Situational Awareness* enables players to improve this skill, extending the map range for NPC visibility and targeting.
