Key differences for the Wizard class on THJ compared to live or other servers:

- Most sources of increased spell critical damage and critical hit chance will stack
- AA's largely custom with many out of era AAs allowed in every expansion, but tuned for balance
- Custom Wizard Epic 1.0 {{<item id="???" name="Staff of the Four" link="/equipment-guide/epics/wiz-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

## Wizard Level 1 Autogranted AAs

{{<details title="Harvest of Druzzil (Active)">}}
This ability gathers streams of additional mana into your being.
{{</details>}}

{{<details title="Improved Familiar (Active)">}}
This ability will summon an improved familiar that is an upgrade from the greater familiar.  This improved familiar is higher in level, has more hit points, and is very resistant to all spells.  The familiar provides an increase to resists, spell critical chance, mana and effective caster level of spells cast.
{{</details>}}

{{<details title="Arcane Overkill (Passive)">}}
This adds a chance for you to gain mana back when you score a killing strike with a spell.
{{</details>}}

{{<details title="Bazaar and Back Gate (Active)">}}
Every 10 minutes, allows you to teleport to the Bazaar when out of combat.
{{</details>}}

{{<details title="Eyes Wide Open Rank 8 (Passive)">}}
This passive ability increases the capacity of your extended target window by one slot per rank.
{{</details>}}

{{<details title="Mystical Attuning Rank 5 (Passive)">}}
This ability increases the number of mystical effects that can affect you at once by 1 per rank.
{{</details>}}

## Wizard Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Wizard shouldn't have when you start (like Bash or Mend), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
