- Buffs cast on self or group do not expire
- When paired with other pet classes, more than one pet may be active at once (one per class)
- Rabid Bear has been customized for the server, adjusting the stats provided and allowing for a more consistent uptime when fully upgraded
- Shaman start level 1 with the following AAs: 'Ancestral Aid Rank 1', 'Summon Companion Rank 1', 'Group Shrink', 'Pet Affinity', 'Pet Discipline', 'Destructive Cascade Rank 1', 'Harmonious Attack Rank 5', 'Eyes Wide Open Rank 8', 'Mystical Attuning Rank 5', 'Mnemonic Retention Rank 4', 'Bazaar and Back Gate', 'Consume Item'
- Custom Shaman Epic 1.0 {{<item id="#" name="Spear of Fate" link="/equipment-guide/epics/shm-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

## Shaman Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Shaman shouldn't have when you start (like Archery), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
