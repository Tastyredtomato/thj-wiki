![Header Image](/images/classes.webp)

Key differences for the Warrior class on THJ compared to live or other servers:

- Many discs have had their timers reduced to 15 minutes or less
- AA's largely custom with many out of era AAs allowed in every expansion, but tuned for balance
- Custom Warrior Epic 1.0 {{<item id="???" name="Jagged Blade of War" link="/equipment-guide/epics/war-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

## Warrior Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Warrior shouldn't have when you start (like Bash or Mend), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
