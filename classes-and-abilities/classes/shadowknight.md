Key differences for the Shadow Knight class on THJ compared to live or other servers:

- Spells and skills have been modified or customized in some places
- AA's largely custom with many out of era AAs allowed in every expansion, but tuned for balance
- Shadow Knights start level 1 with the following AAs: 'Explosion of Spite', 'Mortal Coil','Eyes Wide Open Rank 8', 'Mystical Attuning Rank 5', 'Bazaar and Back Gate', and 'Consume Item'
- Custom Shadow Knight Epic 1.0 {{<item id="???" name="Innoruuk's Curse" link="/equipment-guide/epics/shd-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

## Shadow Knight Level 1 Autogranted AAs

{{<details title="Explosion of Spite (Active)">}}
Every 60 seconds, this ability will fill creatures closely around you with hatred towards you.
{{</details>}}

{{<details title="Mortal Coil (Active)">}}
When the Shadow Knight gets credit for a successful kill, Mortal Coil grants a 25% chance to harvest the energy of his victim’s departing essence. This energy improves the Shadow Knight’s AC and grants him the ability to draw hit points from his enemies as he attacks them.

Every 10 minutes, allows you to teleport to the Bazaar when out of combat.

{{<details title="Mystical Attuning Rank 5 (Passive)">}}

## Shadow Knight Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Shadow Knight shouldn't have when you start (like Kick), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
