Key differences for the Berserker class on THJ compared to live or other servers:

- Playable in Classic!
- Out of era access to skill levels/alternate advancements/disciplines/epic
- Berserkers start level 1 with the following AAs: 'Rampage', 'Vehement Rage', 'Killing Spree', 'Eyes Wide Open Rank 8', 'Mystical Attuning Rank 5', 'Bazaar and Back Gate', and 'Consume Item'
- Custom Berserker Epic 1.0 {{<item id="20542" name="Kerasian Axe of Ire" link="/equipment-guide/epics/ber-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

## Berserker Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Berserker shouldn't have when you start (like hide), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
