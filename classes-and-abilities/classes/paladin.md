Key differences for the Paladin class on THJ compared to live or other servers:

- Spells and skills have been modified or customized in some places
- AA's largely custom with many out of era AAs allowed in every expansion, but tuned for balance
- Paladins start level 1 with the following AAs: 'Divine Stun', 'Blessing of Life','Eyes Wide Open Rank 8', 'Mystical Attuning Rank 5', 'Bazaar and Back Gate', and 'Consume Item'
- Custom Paladin Epic 1.0 {{<item id="???" name="Fiery Defender" link="/equipment-guide/epics/pal-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

## Paladin Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Paladin shouldn't have when you start (like Kick), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
