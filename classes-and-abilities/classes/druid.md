Key differences for the Druid class on THJ compared to live or other servers:

- Most Druid buffs do not fade when cast on yourself, or on group members as long as you're in the same zone and in the same group. Clickable item effects are permanent as long as the item is equipped.
- As a pet class, your summoned pet(s) can be buffed by not only your own beneficial spells (and bard songs), but from other players spells and clickable items.
- Druids start level 1 with the following AAs: 'Summon Companion', 'Entrap', 'Pet Affinity', 'Spirit of the Wood', 'Destructive Cascade', 'Pet Discipline', 'Mnemonic Retention Rank 4', 'Eyes Wide Open Rank 8', 'Mystical Attuning Rank 5', 'Bazaar and Back Gate', 'Consume Item'
- Custom Druid Epic 1.0 {{<item id="20542" name="Nature Walker's Scimitar" link="/equipment-guide/epics/dru-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

## Druid Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Druid shouldn't have when you start (like Mend or Remove Trap), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
