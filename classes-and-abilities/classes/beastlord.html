<p>Key differences for the Beastlord class on THJ compared to live or other servers:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a pet class, your summoned pet can be buffed by not only your own beneficial spells and abilities but also by your other chosen classes beneficial spells and abilities (including bard songs).<br>
Some buff spells do not fully stack their effects when they overlap. i.e. the haste portion of Necromancer Intensify Death, Magician Burnout</li>
<li>Custom Beastlord Epic 1.0 {{}}, available for completion once Luclin is released</li>
</ul>

<p>{{</p><details title="Chameleon Strike Rank 1 of 2 (Active)">}}<br>

{{</details><div>}}</div><p></p>
<p>{{</p><details title="Pet Affinity (Passive)">}}<br>

<p>{{</p><details title="Bite of the Asp Rank 1 of 3 (Active)">}}<br>

{{</details><div>}}</div><p></p>
<p>{{</p><details title="Group Shrink (Active)">}}<br>
This ability will cause nearby members of your group to shrink in stature.<br>
{{</details><div>}}</div><p></p>
<p>{{</p><details title="Pet Discipline (Passive)">}}<br>
This ability will allow you to give your pet a 'hold' command until explicitly told to attack. Usage: /pet hold. Pet Hold is now a state that your pet is either in or not. When your pet is in the hold state, your pet will only attack something when you tell it to, and your pet will continue to attack anything on its hate list after that point. Once the encounter is finished, your pet will automatically go back to a held state. If your pet is never told to exclusively attack anything, your pet will never attack anything, even if something is attacking it. This ability also grants the "Greater Pet Hold" command which forces your pet to not add anything to its hate list unless specifically added by you when greater hold is activated. You can add a target to your pet's hate list with either attack or qattack.<br>

<h2 class="toc-header" id="beastlord-skills"> Beastlord Skills</h2>
<p>Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Beastlord shouldn't have when you start (like Kick), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.</p>
