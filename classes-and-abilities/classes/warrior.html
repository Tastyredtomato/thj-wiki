<h2 class="toc-header" id="warrior-skills"> Warrior Skills</h2>
<p>Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Warrior shouldn't have when you start (like Bash or Mend), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.</p>
