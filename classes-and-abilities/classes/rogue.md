![Header Image](/images/classes.webp)

Key differences for the Rogue class on THJ compared to live or other servers:

- Out of era access to skill levels/alternate advancements/disciplines
- Rogues start level 1 with the following AAs: 'Chaotic Stab', 'Shroud of Stealth', 'Killing Spree', 'Eyes Wide Open Rank 8', 'Mystical Attuning Rank 5', 'Bazaar and Back Gate', and 'Consume Item'
- Custom Rogue Epic 1.0 {{<item id="???" name="Ragebringer" link="/equipment-guide/epics/rog-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

## Rogue Level 1 Autogranted AAs

{{<details title="Chaotic Stab (Passive)">}}
This ability will allow you to do minimal backstab damage on your backstab attempt, even if you are not positioned behind the monster. {{</details>}}

{{<details title="Shroud of Stealth (Passive)">}}
This ability provides a previously unheard of level of stealth. The Rogue is able to draw shadows about himself so completely, even creatures that are normally not fooled by such trickery are frequently unable to see him.
{{</details>}}

{{<details title="Killing Spree (Passive)">}}
After slaying a non-trivial con enemy, you have a 10% chance per rank to enter a battle frenzy that instantly boosts your endurance slightly as well as increases your offensive damage for the next 30 seconds.
{{</details>}}

{{<details title="Bazaar and Back Gate (Active)">}}
Every 10 minutes, allows you to teleport to the Bazaar when out of combat.
{{</details>}}

{{<details title="Eyes Wide Open Rank 8 (Passive)">}}
This passive ability increases the capacity of your extended target window by one slot per rank.
{{</details>}}

{{<details title="Mystical Attuning Rank 5 (Passive)">}}
This ability increases the number of mystical effects that can affect you at once by 1 per rank.
{{</details>}}

## Rogue Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Rogue shouldn't have when you start (like Kick), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
