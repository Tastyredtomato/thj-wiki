Key differences for the Monk class on THJ compared to live or other servers:

- Many discs have had their timers reduced to 15 minutes or less.  Voiddance and Whirlwind have been reduced to 28 minutes.
- AA's largely custom with many out of era AAs allowed in every expansion, but tuned for balance
- Fists of Steel renamed to Way of Steel. Way of Steel procs off kicks and strikes and also increases the damage of kicks and strikes the same way Fists of Steel increased H2H damage traditionally. Way of Steel does not increase H2H damage.
- Weight penalties do not apply to monks, wear whatever you want, carry whatever you want; however there are AC bonuses for keeping that weight low
- Unarmed attack damage/delay has been increased
- Custom Monk Epic 1.0 {{<item id="20542" name="Celestial Fists" link="/equipment-guide/epics/mnk-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

## Monk Level 1 Autogranted AAs
{{<details title="Crippling Strike (Active)">}}
This ability grants you an Eagle Strike attack with a chance to reduce the movement speed of the targets.  Ranks in this ability can increase the potency of the snare effect or the damage, or both.  This ability can not be used at the same time as Stunning Kick or Eye Gouge.
{{</details>}}

{{<details title="Technique of Master Wu (Passive)">}}
Under the tutelage of Wu, Monks are able to hone their skills to the point of being able to execute a second and sometimes even a third strike when scoring a hit with their special attacks.  This ability grants a 20 percent increase in the chance of scoring multiple special attacks, per rank, up to rank 5.  Ranks beyond rank 5 increase the chance to perform the third attack in the chain by 5% per rank.

Additional ranks of this skill are granted automatically as you level up.

## Monk Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Monk shouldn't have when you start (like Bash or Mend), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
