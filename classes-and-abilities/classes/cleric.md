Key differences for the Cleric class on THJ compared to live or other servers:

- Most Cleric buffs do not fade when cast on yourself, or on group members as long as you're in the same zone and in the same group. Clickable item effects are permanent as long as the item is equipped.
- Clerics start level 1 with the following AAs: 'Divine Avatar', 'Divine Arbitration', 'Mnemonic Retention Rank 4', 'Eyes Wide Open Rank 8', 'Mystical Attuning Rank 5', 'Bazaar and Back Gate', 'Consume Item'
- Custom Cleric Epic 1.0 {{<item id="20542" name="Water Sprinkler of the Nem Ankh" link="/equipment-guide/epics/clr-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

## Cleric Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Cleric shouldn't have when you start (like Mend or Remove Trap), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
