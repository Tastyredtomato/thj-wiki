Key differences for the Ranger class on THJ compared to live or other servers:

- Bows can be used in melee range, and are bow damage is heavily modified to be affected by double/triple attack, and veteran's wrath AA's.
- Level 29 and 39 spells 'Flaming Arrow' and 'Burning Arrow' apply a damage over time effect and a debuff increasing archery damage taken by 10 and 20%, respectively.
- 'Trick Shot' line of AA's do not consume additional arrows.
- Rangers start level 1 with the following AAs: 'Entrap', 'Auspice of the Hunter', 'Endless Quiver', 'Bow Mastery', 'Eyes Wide Open Rank 8', 'Mystical Attuning Rank 5', 'Bazaar and Back Gate', 'Consume Item'
- Rangers gain ranks of 'Archery Mastery' and 'Trick Shot' for free when leveling.

## Ranger Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Ranger shouldn't have when you start (like Bash or Mend), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
