<p>Key differences for the Magician class on THJ compared to live or other servers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pet overall stats have been increased compared to live</li>
<li>At level 50, you gain an ability called Dimensional Armory. This summons a magical ring with allows you to an extradimensional space. Your summoned minion (Magician pets only) also have access to this space, and will equip any items placed within in order to enhance their combat abilities.</li>
<li>Mage's "Burnout" pet buff line, Necromancers "Augment" pet buff line and, Beastlord's "Quickening" pet buff line all stack with each other</li>
<li>Custom Magician Epic 1.0 {{}}, available for completion once Kunark is released</li>
</ul>

<p>{{</p><details title="Pet Discipline (Passive)">}}<br>
This ability will allow you to give your pet a "hold" command until explicitly told to attack.  Usage: /pet hold.  Pet Hold is now a state that your pet is either in or not.  When your pet is in the hold state, your pet will only attack something when you tell it to, and your pet will continue attacking anything on it's hate list after that point.  Once the encounter is finished, your pet will automatically go back to a held state.  If your pet is never to exclusively attack anything, your pet will never attack anything, even if something is attacking i t.  This ability also grants the "Greater Pet Hold" command which forces your pet to not add anything to its hatelist unless specifically added by you when greater hold is activated.  You can add a target to your pet's hatelist with either attack or qattack.{{</details><div>}}</div><p></p>

<h2 class="toc-header" id="magician-skills"> Magician Skills</h2>
<p>Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Magician shouldn't have when you start (like Bash or Mend), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.</p>
