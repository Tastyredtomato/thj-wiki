Key differences for the Necromancer class on THJ compared to live or other servers:

- Most Necromancer buffs do not fade when cast on yourself, or on group members as long as you're in the same zone and in the same group. Clickable item effects are permanent as long as the item is equipped.
- As a pet class, your summoned pet(s) can be buffed by not only your own beneficial spells (and bard songs), but from other players spells and clickable items
- Necromancers have the ability to charm undead at later levels, but you cannot have your summoned pet and a charmed pet at the same time
- Necromancers start level 1 with the following AAs: 'Pestilent Paralysis', 'Pet Affinity', 'Pet Discipline', 'Destructive Cascade', 'Summon Companion', 'Consume Item', 'Mnemonic Retention Rank 4', 'Eyes Wide Open Rank 8', 'Mystical Attuning Rank 5', 'Bazaar and Back Gate', 'Consume Item'
- Custom Necromancer Epic 1.0 {{<item id="20542" name="Scythe of the Shadowed Soul" link="/equipment-guide/epics/nec-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

## Necromancer Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Necromancer shouldn't have when you start (like Mend or Remove Trap), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
