# ![Necromancer](/necromancer.gif) Necromancer Class

> The Necromancer class on **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** has several unique mechanics compared to Live servers. With **persistent buffs, enhanced pet interactions, and access to powerful AAs**, Necromancers play a versatile role as **damage dealers and pet-based controllers**. This guide outlines the key differences, auto-granted AAs, skill progression, and class mechanics.

Necromancers on THJ benefit from **persistent buffs, unique pet mechanics, and out-of-era AAs** that enhance their **damage-dealing and utility** roles. Mastering these abilities will allow players to **optimize their damage-over-time spells, undead control, and pet efficiency** for maximum effectiveness.

## Necromancer Skills

Necromancers receive all class skills **automatically at level 1**, increasing them through use. Some skills (e.g., *Mend* or *Remove Trap*) may appear in the UI due to the server’s multiclassing system, but they cannot be used unless you assign at least one skill point.
