# ![Wizard](/wizard.gif) Wizard Class 

> The Wizard class on **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** features several unique enhancements compared to Live servers. With **customized spell crit mechanics, expanded AA availability, and specialized damage potential**, Wizards excel as **high-burst spellcasters**. This guide covers key differences, auto-granted AAs, skill progression, and class mechanics.

Wizards on THJ benefit from **expanded spell crit stacking, powerful familiars, and out-of-era AAs** that enhance their **damage potential and mana sustainability**. Mastering these abilities will allow players to optimize their **burst DPS, mana efficiency, and spell rotations** for maximum effectiveness.

## Wizard Skills

Wizards receive all class skills **automatically at level 1**, increasing them through use. Some skills (e.g., *Bash* or *Mend*) may appear in the UI due to the server’s multiclass system, but they cannot be used unless you assign at least one skill point.
