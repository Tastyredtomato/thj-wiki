# ![Ranger](/ranger.gif) Ranger Class 

> The Ranger class on **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** has several unique enhancements compared to Live servers. With improved archery mechanics, enhanced AAs, and custom skill scaling, Rangers offer an optimized balance between melee and ranged combat. This guide covers the key differences, auto-granted AAs, skill progression, and class mechanics.

Rangers on THJ benefit from **melee-compatible archery, enhanced auto-granted AAs, and stacking offensive buffs**. Understanding these mechanics will allow players to optimize their **ranged damage, melee versatility, and group utility** for maximum effectiveness.

## Ranger Skills

Rangers receive all class skills **automatically at level 1**, increasing them through use. Some skills (e.g., *Bash* or *Mend*) may appear due to the server’s multiclassing system, but they cannot be used unless you assign at least one skill point.
