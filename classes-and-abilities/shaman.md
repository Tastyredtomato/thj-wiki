# ![Shaman](/shaman.gif) Shaman Class 


> The Shaman class on **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** has several enhancements compared to Live servers. With **persistent buffs, enhanced pet synergy, and custom AA mechanics**, Shamans excel in **support, damage-over-time (DoT), and healing roles**. This guide covers the key differences, auto-granted AAs, skill progression, and class mechanics.

Shamans on THJ benefit from **persistent buffs, powerful pet interactions, and out-of-era AAs** that enhance their **support, healing, and damage-over-time capabilities**. Mastering these abilities will allow players to **maximize their effectiveness in both solo and group play**.

## Shaman Skills

Shamans receive all class skills **automatically at level 1**, increasing them through use. Some skills (e.g., *Archery*) may appear due to the server’s multiclassing system, but they cannot be used unless assigned at least one skill point.
