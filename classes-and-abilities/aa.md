While active, a portion of the damage you sustain is taken out of your mana rather than your hit points.  Any damage that cannot be absorbed by your mana comes off your hit points instead.  The first rank of this ability will absorb 10 hits from spell or melee attacks before fading, the second rank will absorb 20, and the third will absorb 30, the fourth rank will absorb 40 hits, the fifth by 50, the sixth rank 60 hits. Additional ranks beyond rank 6 further increase the amount of damage that is mitigated by converting your mana. Each rank starting from rank 10 also increases the number of hits the ability absorbs.

Each rank in this ability gives rogues an increasing chance to remain hidden when they are an indirect target of an Area-of-Effect spell.  At the highest rank, a resisted AoE spell will never break Hide and there is a good chance that the rogue will remain hidden even when a spell successfully hits them.  Nerves of Steel does not help when the rogue is the direct target of an AoE spell (if they are the direct target, then they've already been spotted). All ranks beyond rank 5 further increase the chance of remaining sneaking even if you do not resist the AoE spell.

This ability will allow you to give your pet a 'hold' command until explicitly told to attack. Usage: /pet hold. Pet Hold is now a state that your pet is either in or not. When your pet is in the hold state, your pet will only attack something when you tell it to, and your pet will continue to attack anything on its hate list after that point. Once the encounter is finished, your pet will automatically go back to a held state. If your pet is never told to exclusively attack anything, your pet will never attack anything, even if something is attacking it. This ability also grants the "Greater Pet Hold" command which forces your pet to not add anything to its hatelist unless specifically added by you when greater hold is activated. You can add a target to your pet's hatelist with either attack or qattack.

Each rank in this ability gives rogues an increasing chance to remain hidden when they are an indirect target of an Area-of-Effect spell.  At the highest rank, a resisted AoE spell will never break Hide and there is a good chance that the rogue will remain hidden even when a spell successfully hits them.  Nerves of Steel does not help when the rogue is the direct target of an AoE spell (if they are the direct target, then they've already been spotted). All ranks beyond rank 5 further increase the chance of remaining sneaking even if you do not resist the AoE spell.

This ability will allow you to give your pet a 'hold' command until explicitly told to attack. Usage: /pet hold. Pet Hold is now a state that your pet is either in or not. When your pet is in the hold state, your pet will only attack something when you tell it to, and your pet will continue to attack anything on its hate list after that point. Once the encounter is finished, your pet will automatically go back to a held state. If your pet is never told to exclusively attack anything, your pet will never attack anything, even if something is attacking it. This ability also grants the "Greater Pet Hold" command which forces your pet to not add anything to its hatelist unless specifically added by you when greater hold is activated. You can add a target to your pet's hatelist with either attack or qattack.
