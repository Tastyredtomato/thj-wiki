# ![cleric.gif](/cleric.gif) Cleric Class


> The Cleric class on **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** has several unique mechanics compared to Live servers and other emulated servers. This guide covers these differences, auto-granted AAs, skill progression, and trade skills.

Clerics on THJ have persistent buffs, unique auto-granted AAs, and expanded trade skill opportunities. Understanding these mechanics can help players optimize their builds for healing, support, and combat scenarios. Clerics are *less* support here and *more* serious damage.

## Cleric Skills
