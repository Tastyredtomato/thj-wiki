# ![Enchanter](/enchanter.gif)Enchanter Class 


> Enchanters in **The Heroes' Journey (THJ)** differ significantly from traditional enchanters on Live servers. They have access to powerful out-of-era **Alternate Abilities (AAs)** that enhance their **support, offensive, and defensive** capabilities. This guide outlines these unique abilities, skill progression, and class mechanics.

Enchanters on THJ offer **powerful debuffs, improved charm mechanics, and unique out-of-era AAs** that make them a formidable support and utility class. Understanding these mechanics will allow players to optimize their crowd control, debuffing, and mana management strategies.

## Key Differences from Live

- **Enhanced Debuffing**:
  - **Deep Sleep**: Reduces boss damage, helping mitigate damage in long fights.  
  - **Mental Contortion**: Applies a **damage-over-time (DoT)** that also reduces boss damage over time.
- **Improved Offensive Capabilities**:
  - **Doppelganger**: Summons a **swarm pet** that deals **single-target damage**, adding offense to the traditionally support-heavy class.  
  - **Illusions of Grandeur**: On a **10-minute cooldown**, **boosts spell critical rate and damage** for the entire group.
- **Mana Sustainability**: Several AAs provide **mana replenishment** to maintain performance in extended fights.
- **Dire Charm**: Grants a **permanent, un-dispellable charm** on any **light-blue charmable monster**.
- **Charm Overhaul**:
  - Charm spells are **evenly distributed across levels**.
  - **Charm breaks are less frequent**.
  - **Charm is refreshable** without re-charming the target.
  - The **Charm buff now grants accuracy and mitigation** to the pet.
- **Custom Enchanter Epic 1.0** available once **Kunark** is released.

## Enchanter Skills

Enchanters receive all class skills **automatically at level 1**, increasing them through use. Some skills (e.g., *Bash* or *Mend*) may appear due to the serverâ€™s multiclassing system, but they cannot be used unless assigned at least one skill point.
