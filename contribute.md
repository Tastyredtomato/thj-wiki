## Further Formatting Help

**Wiki.js Formatting Guides**:
   - You can access the official Wiki.js Markdown guide here:
   - For a comprehensive overview of Markdown syntax supported by Wiki.js, refer to this resource: https://docs.requarks.io/editors/markdown

## Details Dropdowns

**Using `<details>` Dropdowns in Wiki.js**:
   - Wiki.js supports HTML tags within its Markdown editor, allowing you to create collapsible sections using the `<details>` and `<summary>` tags.
   - Here's an example of how to implement a dropdown:

     ```markdown
     <details>
       <summary>Click to expand</summary>
       <p>This content is hidden until the dropdown is expanded.</p>
     </details>
     ```

   - When rendered, it appears as:

     <details>
       <summary>Click to expand</summary>
       <p>This content is hidden until the dropdown is expanded.</p>
     </details>

   - This method is effective for organizing content and enhancing readability.
