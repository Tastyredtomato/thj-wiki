Pending Reboot\Luck in getting a fresh zs
```
- Buff stacking adjusted
  - Short Buffs (Songs) and Long Buffs no longer have stacking conflicts between categories.
  - Detrimental and Beneficial spells no longer have stacking conflicts between categories.
  - The EFFECTS of the buffs may not stack (mostly between Detrimental and Beneficial), but the buff icons themselves won't block or overwrite. This mostly applies to certain effects like haste\slow.
- Casting skills can only increase from spells cast from spellgems
- Bard Songs will no longer fade just because they ran out of Rune capacity
- Re-introduced Extended Pet Affinity.
  - Now applies to instant-duration (ie heals, cures) as well. Pets need a little bit of love in terms of survivability.
- Instrument modifiers no longer scale effects inappropriately.
